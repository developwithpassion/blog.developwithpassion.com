I might be late of the presses making the announcement, but I am sure that I am one of the few who has been updating their build of ReSharper almost daily for the last couple of moths (except when it is a not recommended build). I just can't understate the awesomeness of this amazing tool!! I plan to do a ReSharper Jedi coding session with music and all in the next couple of weeks where I am going to go full tilt with Viemu and ReSharper 4.0. I think that the best way to sell people on the value of code productivity tools is to show them in action.  
If you feel like living on the edge, go and download the latest nightly build from [here](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+Nightly+Builds).  
Develop With Passion
