Lots of people ask me "How do you get better as a developer?" my answer is simple, "Develop"!! You can read all you want, until you start applying what you are learning the information is useless. 
On that note, I greatly appreciate the work that [Billy McCafferty](http://devlicio.us/blogs/billy_mccafferty/) is doing for the dev community by taking the time to create and publish a set of [Refactoring challenges](http://devlicio.us/blogs/billy_mccafferty/archive/2006/11/13/refactor-it-the-weekly-book-giveaway.aspx). It takes a lot of personal time and effort to put something like that out there (speaking from experience), so show him your appreciation by downloading the code and "Refactor mercilessly". As a mentor in a dev shop, some (one) of the keeners are eager to download the code and clean it up, which gives me an opportunity to share some small nuggets of wisdom also!! 
Thanks again Bill.
