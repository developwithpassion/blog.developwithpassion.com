I finally submitted my presentation topic for the [Calgary Code Camp](http://www.calgarycodecamp.com/) . The session is titled TDD, Dependency Injection and the Data Access Layer:<font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><?xml:namespace prefix ="" o /><o:p> </o:p></span></font>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In this session attendees will learn how to utilise the concepts of TDD and Dependency Injection to build up a data access layer piece by piece. During the course of the session attendees will learn the value of coding to interfaces as well as how applying the technique of dependency injection can help you build objects that are more loosely coupled to one another.</span></font></div></li></ul>

I look forward to speaking with any reader of this blog who attends the code camp.
