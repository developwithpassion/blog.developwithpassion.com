Stephen McMahon sent me a link to an awesome [set of short videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFUOrw8AvEI&feature=related) by a man named [James Ray](http://jamesray.com/). This guy seems to share a lot of the ideas and approaches that have brought me success to this point in my career.  
If you ignore the infomercial type feel of the video, I am sure that you will enjoy the message that he is trying to share. I particularly love the story about the shoe shiner, err I mean "image consultant"!!  
Watching this video reminds me of something that my Dad said to me a long time ago:  
"I don't care if you choose to be a garbageman, you will do it to the best of your abilities and you will enjoy it!!"  
Develop With Passion!!
