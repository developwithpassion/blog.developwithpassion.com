If you have been on the fence, now is the time to truly jump onto the ground and start running again in VS!!  
[ReSharper 4.0 RC](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/beta/beta.html) is now available!!  
I cannot stress enough the awesomeness that is this tool!! It has gotten to the point (I was there a long time ago) where I will not code at a machine that does not have ReSharper installed. It becomes a deal breaker for me with new clients that I engage if they are not willing to install ReSharper on the client machines (of course, there is the old ask for forgiveness, not permission route for this one also!!).  
If you are still coding in Visual Studio using Raw Visual Studio then all I can say is that ignorance has to be bliss, as you truly cannot comprehend the productivity enhancements that can come once you have a truly powerful editor in your hands. For me the sweet spot seems to be ReSharper + [VIEmu](http://www.viemu.com/).  
If you happen to be a user group leader/attendee and want to see what ReSharper can really do when opened up full tilt, get in contact with me and I would be happy to come and give a live coding demo!! Or you could just check out a session of the [tool in action](http://resharper.blogspot.com/2007/05/jedi-way-coding-in-reverse.html) recorded by ReSharper Jedi Master : Ilya Ryzhenkov.  
Are you ready to walk the path of the ReSharper Jedi??  
Develop With Passion!!
