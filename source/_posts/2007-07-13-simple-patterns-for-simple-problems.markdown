James Kovacs and I are presenting at the Calgary .Net User Group Thursday, July 19th 2007. The session is called : 'Simple Patterns for Simple Problems'. Here is the abstract:<span class="Normal" id="dnn_ctr426_HtmlModule__ctl0_lblContent">

<font face="Verdana" size="2">Everyone has that little (or not so little) class called Utility that holds all kinds of intersting bits of business logic. It is a hodge-podge of code that you're not sure where to put. This session will examine some common types of methods found in utility classes and how to refactor your design using simple patterns to eliminate these troublesome kitchen-sink classes. </font>

Calgary AB Canada
Conference Room CP1-1106
(the elevator will be open to the floor between 11:30 and 12:00 so no security pass will be required)</font>

I think that the presentation should be a lot of fun, and I think there will be lots of information that people will be able to glean from the patterns and techniques presented.

If you in Calgary on that day, register for what promises to be an interesting topic.

Develop With Passion!!</span>
