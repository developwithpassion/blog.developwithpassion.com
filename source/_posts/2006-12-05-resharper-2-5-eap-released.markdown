If you like to play with the latest and greatest that JetBrains has to offer, then head [here](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/Download) to download the EAP version of ReSharper 2.5. If you have already been using the EAP version, then there is not much I can say about it that you have not already seen.  
If, on the other hand, you have not been using the 2.5 release then you are in for a few surprises. Along with tightening up the user interface (which looks really nice now), there are a number of new features that ReSharper users will welcome with open arms. 
Instead of me duplicating information, check out the RoadMap for the product [here](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+2.5+Roadmap). 
Develop with pleasure!!
