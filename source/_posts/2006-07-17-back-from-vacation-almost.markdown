Well, it's been about 2 weeks since my last post. My family and I arrived from an amazing vacation at DisneyWorld just yesterday at 4:00AM. Just when I thought we could enjoy being back at home, we have to hit the road again. A family emergency is pulling us away for another week. I am posting this as information for people who are trying to get a hold of me and are receiving no response. As soon as I am back and settled I will make sure to respond to any and all questions/emails I have received over the last little while.

Thanks for your patience.
