Having had such an amazing response from the last offer (who would have thought people liked free stuff!!). I thought I would throw this out there again and offer a gift certificate to buy this book to the first 3 people who express interest.

In order to manage the avalanche of responses, if you do not receive a response from me by end of day tomorrow, assume that you were not one of the first 3 respondents.

The following blurb, is the content from my original post about [The Dream Giver](http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Giver-Bruce-Wilkinson/dp/159052201X):


Having recommended this book to a couple of friends I thought I would take the time to write my 2 cents on what could potentially be a life changing book for many people. While reading this book it continually reminded me of the wonders that God has in store when you step out of your comfort zone to follow "Your Big Dream".


For the people reading this blog who do not care much for the Christian influence in the book, don't let that discourage you from what could be an amazing read and inspiration. I am positive that you will still be able to read the book and empathize with a lot with the trials and tribulations of the main character as he pursues his big dream.

Read the following blurb that will hopefully get the engines cranked for you to go out and read the book:

<strong>_________________________________________________________________</strong>

<strong>Are you living your dream— or just living your life?</strong>

<strong>Welcome to a little story about a very big idea. This compelling modern-day parable tells the story of Ordinary, who dares to leave the Land of Familiar to pursue his Big Dream.</strong>

<strong>You, too, have been given a Big Dream. One that can change your life. One that the Dream Giver wants you to achieve. Does your Big Dream seem hopelessly out of reach? Are you waiting for something or someone to make your dream happen?</strong>

<strong>Then you’re ready for [The Dream Giver](http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Giver-Bruce-Wilkinson/dp/159052201X).</strong>

<strong>Let Bruce Wilkinson show you how to rise above the ordinary, conquer your fears, and overcome the obstacles that keep you from living your Big Dream.</strong>

<strong>You were made for this. Now it’s time to begin your journey.</strong>

________________________________________________________________

The <strong>first 3 people to email me with interest in this book</strong> will receive an amazon gift certificate in the amount required to purchase the book.

Are you ready to begin you journey?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have to reiterate that I do not profit in any way shape or form from any profits relating to the sale of the book. I truly believe that this book is one of many that has the potential to transform lives.

If you are ready to start stepping out of the land of familiar into the unknown then ping me back and get ready to start stepping through the invisible wall of fear to pursue your big dream(all of these terms are shamelessly pulled from the book!!).

Live With Passion!!
