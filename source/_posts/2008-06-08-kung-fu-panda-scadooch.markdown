After a fun filled day of goofing around and running up and down the mall with my family we caught the 7PM Imax showing of Kung Fu Panda!!  
Once again, I was blown away by the quality of the animation that Dreamworks manages to put together. The visuals are truly dazzling. I am not going to spoil the movie for anyone, but the movie is brilliant. If it can keep our 2 year old engaged for over one and a half hours then it has our vote!!  
The voice acting is truly awesome, and Jack Black is the perfect person they could have chosen to play the hilarious Po. My wife and I burst out laughing together several times during the movie!!  
If you are looking for a feel good family flick, then check out Kung Fu Panda as soon as you can!!
