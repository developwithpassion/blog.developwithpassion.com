Thanks to Guy Kawasaki, for pointing me in the direction of the Menlo Park Presbyterian Church website. Even if you are not a believer, I think that everyone can learn something by watching the sermon [Jesus & Your Job](http://data.mppc.org/sermon/video.php?sermon_ID=283). 
Often I can fall into the trap of getting caught up in the politics of the environment around me, I need to remember first and foremost why I am usually brought in, in the first place : To Develop and Mentor. I love how Nancy continually stresses the point that "work is the creation of value", all of us have the capacity to influence the attitudes of the people that we work with. Some of us have the blessing of being able to completely turn around the feelings of an entire environment. The trick is to ensure that we try to maintain a positive outlook on what can sometimes be a not great situation. 
Again, watch the video, I am sure that everyone can take away some learning from it.
