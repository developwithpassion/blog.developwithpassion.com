This is an announcement of a brand new 1 day remote course. One of many "micro" courses that are about the be published and added to the Nothin But * line of courses.<h1> Overview</h1>Nothin But ReSharper is a one day deep dive into the R# visual studio plugin, that can accelerate you development in ways that you are probably unaware of if you have not seen it in action. In this session you will learn how to take advantage of R# to enable you to accomplish the following taks inside the ide much faster: <ul>  <li> Micro Code Generation </li>  <li> Refactoring </li>  <li> Code Navigation </li>  <li> Code Analysis </li>  </ul><h1> Prerequisites</h1><div>  
 The only real prerequisites for this course are the following: <ul>  <li> Basic knowledge of C# </li>  <li> Existing experience with Visual Studio</li></ul></div>

<h1> Hardware/Software Requirements</h1>

<div>  
 You will need to make sure that you have a configuration that will allow you to work effectively in a remote training venue. An ideal configuration would be as follows: <ul>  <li> Dual Monitor Setup </li>  <li> HeadSet w/ microphone </li>  <li> GoToMeeting Client </li>  <li> Windows 7/XP/Vista </li>  <li> Visual Studio 2010 </li>  <li> ReSharper 5.1 </li>  </ul></div>

With only a day required to participate, and at a cost of $300, it is a great way to get yourself out of a comfort zone for a short period of time, participate from your own location, collaborate/discuss with people from all around the world, and get some awesome learning time in!!

My thought with this, and the other, micro courses is to allow people to get deep dives into specific tools/technologies/approaches, without the battering that usually ensues from a full blown week of 5 12 hour days.
