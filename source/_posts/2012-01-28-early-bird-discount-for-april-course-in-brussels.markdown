The crazy Develop With Passion® training course is coming to Brussels on April 30th!!

This is our first time in Brussels and we are excited for what the potential reception is going to be!!

You may want to consider taking the course if you are:

* Able to free up their week for April 30th - May 4th.
* Looking forward to spending a week with a group of peers on the continual path of mastery
* Ready to come and learn killer coding techniques.
* Wanting to learn principles, patterns, and practices that can help enable them to craft a path to a long lasting career as an effective developer regardless of platform or language.
* Excited about the idea of 5 12 hour days of fast paced coding frenzy
* Comfortable with the thought of pair programming with complete strangers to help them to increase their game!!

Registration for the course can be made [here](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2560727204/eorg). If you register before the end of February and use the discount code: earlybirdforbrusselsis10 , you will receive a 10% discount on the course.

Looking forward to seeing you there!!
