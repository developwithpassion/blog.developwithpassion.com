Looks like TW Studios just released a new offering to the general consumer public.

[CruiseContol Enterprise](http://studios.thoughtworks.com/cruisecontrol) is an interesting offering from TW that looks to add interesting support and consulting features as well as some interesting additions to the actual tool itself.

I could duplicate information and screenshots, but you are better off just taking a look at it!!
