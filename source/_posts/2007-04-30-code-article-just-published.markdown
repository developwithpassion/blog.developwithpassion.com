I'd like to say thank to everyone at CoDe magazine, for coordinating with me to get a new article out of the door.

The article was created as a way to introduce people to the concepts of Layered Architecture, Dependency Inversion, and Dependency Injection.

You can check it out online [here](http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0705071).
