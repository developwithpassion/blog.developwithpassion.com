This is a short 11 minute video that walks you through the process of creating linked clones using VMWare Fusion.

VMWare Fusion fully supports linked clones;unlike VMWare Workstation it does not yet have a UI to create and manage them.

This video covers the main points:

* How I organize and separate my vms from the vmdks.
* Creating linked clones
