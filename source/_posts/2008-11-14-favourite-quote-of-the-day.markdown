In response to a great conversation I had with a friend, I just wanted to share a quote that I read in the latest issue of Psychology Today. The article focused on the concept of late bloomers in different fields of work. This quote is very similar to statements that I make in my courses:  
“The moment we believe success is determined by an ingrained level of ability, as opposed to resilience and hard work, we will be brittle in the face of adversity”  <blockquote>   
Develop With Passion!!</blockquote>
