Just a quick note to remind people who are still interested in signing up for the course that you should get over to  
<a title="https://www.acteva.com/go/jboodhoo" href="https://www.acteva.com/go/jboodhoo">https://www.acteva.com/go/jboodhoo</a> 
and register. As others who have already taken the course [will attest](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/NothinButNetEdmontonRecap.aspx), this is not your standard fare, .Net course. You will leave this course with some crazy new ideas, as well as a new look on the way you approach software development. 
If you're still interested, register and I'll see you in Richmond at the end of next month!!
