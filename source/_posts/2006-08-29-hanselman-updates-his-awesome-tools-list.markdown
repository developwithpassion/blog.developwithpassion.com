For those of you who are not aware of [Scott Hanselman's Ultimate Developer and Power Tool List for Windows](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2006UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx), I strongly encourage you to head over there as quick as possible and see what you have been missing in your developer toolkit. 
I have been using many of the tools on Scott's list for a long time and they have definitely helped me achieve a greater level of productivity in Windows. 
The only tool that Scott doesn't mention which I think should absolutely be considered as an alternative to CodeRush is [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/). 
I think that both CodeRush and ReSharper are excellent products. As a heavy proponent/practitioner of Test/Behavior Driven Development I feel that ReSharper works with me a lot more naturally than CodeRush. 
If you want to see ReSharper in action (in the context of TDD) take a look at [Part 1 of my Applied Test Driven Development for Web Applications flash video](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/AppliedTestDrivenDevelopmentForWebApplicationsPart1VideoReposted.aspx). 
Thanks Scott for taking the time to build up and provide this list of tools for the developer/power user community.
