I am often surprised by the number of times I hear from students of the [bootcamp](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo) the phrase:  
“I was not prepared for the intensity of the week”!!  
My use of the term bootcamp is not a marketing pitch. You <strong>WILL:</strong>  <ul>   <li><strong>be exhausted at the end of the day</strong></li>    <li><strong>spend no less that 14 hours in a course day</strong></li>    <li><strong>have your longest days on Thursday and Friday (historically, 20 – 24 hours is not uncommon)</strong></li> </ul>  
On the plus side you <strong>WILL </strong>also:  <ul>   <li>get to spend a lot of time pair programming with different groups of people</li>    <li>engage in awesome conversation</li>    <li>watch hilarious video clips during breaks!!</li>    <li>enjoy amazing meals!!</li> </ul>  
The Philadelphia course is pretty much full, so this is really a note to people who will be taking the course next year!!  
Develop With Passion!!
