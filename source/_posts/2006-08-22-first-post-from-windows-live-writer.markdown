Just thought I would fire up Windows Live Writer and give it a quick whirl. The installation was a snap and my first impression of this editor is awesome. Obviously, MS is doing one of the things they do best. Taking an existing product, rebranding it as their own and trying to make it a lot better. This is unfortunate for competitors, but ultimately it is great for us as consumers/developers. 
I can't speak too soon about it's level of functionality compared to BlogJet, though I am going to try using it for the next little while just to get an idea for it's capabilities. 
I already have a license for BlogJet, so I am really just undertaking this out of curiosity to how it compares as a product.
