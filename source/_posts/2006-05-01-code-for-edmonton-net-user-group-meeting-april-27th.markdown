Well, the first meeting of the Edmonton .Net Users Group was fantastic. The Edmonton crowd came out in great numbers (despite the hockey game). There were lots of intelligent questions and the hospitality of the hosts was amazing. As promised, I told the attendees that I would release the [source for the project]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/codeFromEdmugApril27thMeeting/tddDemo.zip) that we tried to build during the session. I have left the code exactly where I left off in the presentation, this will give people an opportunity to finish it up for themselves. In two weeks I will release the completed version of the project, which people can use as a comparison to their own solutions. 

Thanks again to the Edmonton .Net Users Group for inviting me up there!!
