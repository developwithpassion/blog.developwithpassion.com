The good folks at [VSM](http://www.visualstudiomagazine.com/) are currently experiencing problems with their download servers. I have received many requests for the source code to the article that I published on different approaches to databinding. 

You can now download the code [here]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/visualStudioArticleCodeDownload/DataBinding.zip) and hopefully the servers at VSM will be available to download the code soon.

Thanks.
