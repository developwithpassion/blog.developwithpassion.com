If you, or anyone you know, are interested in staring up a user group. [The Igloo Coder](http://igloocoder.com/) is documenting his recipe for success in the [process](http://igloocoder.com/archive/2006/06/13/350.aspx) that he and his band of accomplices have followed to start a relatively new .Net user group in the city of Edmonton, Alberta. A really good read. Having experienced working with this group, I have great expectations for what they are going to be able to accomplish over the next couple of years.
