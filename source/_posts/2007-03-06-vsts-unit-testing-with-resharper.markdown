I am not sure where he finds the time, what with home schooling 2 kids, consulting and speaking, but [James Kovacs](http://www.jameskovacs.com/blog) has managed to write a [plugin](http://www.jameskovacs.com/blog/IntroducingVstsUnitPluginForReSharper.aspx) to allow running VSTS unit tests from within ReSharper. If you happen to be one of those people who has to use the VSTS unit test, and you also have the joy of using ReSharper, head over and download it and give him some feedback!
