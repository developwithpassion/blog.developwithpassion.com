I’ve been out of the loop for quite a while to say the least. So much so that I forgot to announce that I would be offering up 1 scholarship for the Calgary course that is going to be held next week.  
If you live in and around the Calgary area and are thinking you would like to apply for the [course](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo) scholarship then fire me an email at : [jp@developwithpassion.com](mailto:jp@developwithpassion.com) with the following information:  <ol>   <li>How long have you been in the field of software development (not including time in school)?</li>    <li>Why do you think the course would be beneficial to you?</li>    <li>Why should you receive the scholarship?</li>    <li>Contact Information (Phone, Email …)</li> </ol>  
Obviously, I am not expecting a lot of responses seeing as how it is almost the end of the week, which means that if you respond, you may have a high probability of receiving the scholarship. The entries will be quickly reviewed by the scholarship team and we will announce the recipient tomorrow!!  
Develop With Passion!!
