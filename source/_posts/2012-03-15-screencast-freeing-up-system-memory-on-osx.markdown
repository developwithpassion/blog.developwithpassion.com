In this quick video I show you how to use the purge command to quickly free up virtual memory on your machine.

Because I run a fair amount of vms on my machine, at any point in the day I can look at my memory usage and realize that I have almost no memory availabe.

For those that don't want to watch the video (it's only 2 minutes), I start the video having almost 6.81GB inactive and only 284.7GB available (and this is a 16GB machine.)

The long and short is I run the following command:

{% codeblock Free Up Your Memory - purge_memory.sh  %}
purge
{% endcodeblock %}

After the command finished running, I had only 138.6MB of inactive memory and 9.56GB of free memory!!

Here is the video:
