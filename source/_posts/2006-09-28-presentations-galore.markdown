Tonight I have the honor of returning to speak at the [Edmonton .Net User Group](http://www.edmug.net/). The group voted and it looks like people want to see more about Model View Presenter (Passive View, Supervising Controller). I am also going to see if I can sneak in some discussions around enterprise design patterns. 
On Saturday, I will also be attending/presenting at the [Edmonton Code Camp](http://www.edmontoncodecamp.com). If you are going to be in the area, and do not mind hanging out with a bunch of geeks on your Saturday, come down and check out the sessions.
