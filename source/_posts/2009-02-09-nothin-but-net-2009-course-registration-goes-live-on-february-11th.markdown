This post is a quick shout out to all of the people who have contacted me about registration for this years courses.  
Registration will go live for all of the courses on Wednesday, February 11th. This year I am making use of [eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) which means that the 2 options you will have for payment processing will be either an existing paypal account, or your credit card.  
As a reminder, there is a 16 person attendance limit for each class this year!!  
For more information on the class, you can read up about it here: [http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo)  
I look forward to helping you Develop With Passion!!
