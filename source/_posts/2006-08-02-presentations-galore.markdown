Over the last year I have slowly been building up a decent set of presentations that I can present given a short amount of notice. I have been presenting mostly in Canada but am going to start branching out into the US and beyond. Here are some of the presentations that I currently have "ready to present": 
<ul>
<li>Refactoring - An Introduction</li>
<li>Test Driven Development In .Net - An Introduction</li>
<li>Test Driven Development With Mock Objects</li>
<li>Dependency Inversion Principle & Dependency Injection</li>
<li>Model View Presenter - A Better Way To Factor Your Presentation Layer</li>
<li>Patterns For Building An ORM in .Net</li>
<li>Design Patterns - An Introduction</li>
<li>Applied Continuous Integration</li></ul>

If you can think of other presentation topics that might be of interest please feel free to suggest them and I will look at adding them to my collection. Also, if you are interested in having me speak at your user group/company please do not hesitate to contact me.
