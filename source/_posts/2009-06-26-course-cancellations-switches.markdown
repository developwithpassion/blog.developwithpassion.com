Something that has happened more that I would like for this year is the cancellation and switching around of courses due to low interest levels in cities that previously expressed interest.  
Due to low interest there are going to be courses that are cancelled completely as well as some that are going to be swapped out with replacements for new cities that have got in contact.   
Currently the New York Course (October 12th 2009) is being replaced with a course in [Nashville](http://developwithpassioninnashville2009.eventbrite.com/). My apologies go out to the people (ok, person!!) who registered. Also, if the numbers for the Orlando course do not pick up by the middle of July then that course will be completely cancelled.  
I apologize to anyone for any inconvenience this may cause.
