For those of you who have upgraded to the latest versions of TortoiseSVN and are also big keyboard junkies, you are probably quick to notice that most of the accessor key support has disappeared across most of the dialogs. In case this has caused you grief and you are looking for an older version to download (with no success). You can download the 1.5.4 version from right [here]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/2009/june/6/are_you_missing_your_accessor_keys/TortoiseSVN-1.5.4.14259-win32-svn-1.5.3.msi)!
