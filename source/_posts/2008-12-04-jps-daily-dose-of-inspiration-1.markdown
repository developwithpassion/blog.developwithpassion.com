I am sure that sooner or later I am going to get back to posting about technical stuff!! In the meantime I am going to start posting a link a day to either a video/article that will hopefully challenge your attitude toward life (and in turn work).

If you have any articles/videos you think I may be interested in sharing, please feel free to contact me at j[p@developwithpassion.com](mailto:jp@developwithpassion.com) .

Today I will share with you a video that has a great message (that I took from it):

"Imagine what would happen if each one of us displayed this kind of passion......everyday"
