Last week I had the blessing to be able to share the week teaching and learning with a group of awesome individuals who decided to undertake a week of bootcamp style training in my [Nothin But .Net BootCamp](http://developwithpassion.com/training.oo)!!  
The prerequisites were completed to the highest level that I have ever seen in any prior course, and yet we were still able to spent a couple of hours on day 1 drilling into some new areas based around the pre-req exercise.  
What followed was a week of great technical sharing, meals, and heartfelt discussions about life, faith, and technology.  
All in all the stats for the course were as follows:  <ul>   <li>3 - 14 Hour Days</li>    <li>2 - 20+ Hour Days (craziness!!)</li>    <li>200+ Revisions to the source tree</li>    <li>14 awesome meals</li>    <li>60+ Hours of screencasts</li>    <li>1 Amazing experience</li> </ul>  
This course has morphed and changed dramatically since I first started teaching it over a year and a half ago. I thank God for every opportunity that I am given to reach out to people in this fashion. It is a true blessing.  
If you have been on the fence and are thinking about giving yourself a challenge you should think about signing up for one of the [upcoming courses](http://developwithpassion.com/training.oo). You can use it as a way to increase your skills as well as expand your network.
