[Kevin Squires](http://www.squires.ca) just sent me a link to check out [Mojopac](http://www.mojopac.com/portal/content/hellomojo.jsp). Needless to say, I am pretty blown away by the potential for this software. Are you a developer who is tired of configuring your world just the way you want it when you move to a new PC. This looks like it might solve that and a host of other issues dev's typically face working between multiple PC's. 
If you see me come to a presentation in the near future and find me asking any willing participant to donate their laptop, it would solely to be to show off the potential of this software. 
I just picked up a brand new [Western Digital Passport drive](http://www.electronista.com/articles/06/09/12/new.wd.passport.drives/), based off a friends recommendation. This is the perfect device with which I can "free myself from my PC"!! 
Get your Mojo on!!!
