It's a little late, but "Happy new year"!! 
I am completely pumped about the potential for this new year. I am excited about the potential of meeting a torrent of new people while training/presenting/developing!! 
I just got awarded a MVP so I am thrilled that my efforts in the community have been recognized. One of the great things about being an MVP is being in a position to nominate other MVP's. I have met with a lot of people over the last year who definitely (in my opinion) deserve to have their efforts recognized. 
The month of January is already off to a good start. I will be presenting in Calgary on January 10th: 
<strong>Enterprise</strong><strong> Patterns
</strong>With Jean-Paul Boodhoo
Wednesday, January 10th, <strong>2007
</strong>At LUNCH TIME: 12:00pmâ€“1:00pm
Registration start at:  11:30 am
Roxy-Theatre B
Sunlife Plaza Conference Centre
112 - 4th Avenue SW, Calgary 
  
If you are in the Calgary area, feel free to stop by and ask questions/say hi. 
I am also looking forward to January 27th as I will be presenting some sessions at the Victoria code camp. It should be a blast. 
See you on the road!!
