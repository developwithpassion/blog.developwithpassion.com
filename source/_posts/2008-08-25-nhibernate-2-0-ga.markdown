If you have not yet at least spiked an application written with [NHibernate](http://www.nhibernate.org/), now is the time to at least give yourself a 30 minute block to spike it out.  
Download from [here](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73818&package_id=73969) and give yourself a couple of lunch hour breaks to see one way to free yourself from the shackles of 90% of your DB code.  
  
Develop With Passion!!
