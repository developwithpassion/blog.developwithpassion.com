A couple of people have been informing me that they are having trouble getting the source code from the [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/08/DesignPatterns/default.aspx) I wrote working. This is due to the fact that the download made available on MSDN does not contain some of the files required to build the project. To that end, I am making available a [zip file]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/workingSourceCodeForMSDNModelViewPresenterArticle/mvpcode.zip) that contains the correct directory structure (and accompanying readme), that should have been part of the original download. I am also going to get in contact with MSDN Magazine to ensure that they correct the download.

Thanks for your patience, and to the people who took the time to let me know of this error.
