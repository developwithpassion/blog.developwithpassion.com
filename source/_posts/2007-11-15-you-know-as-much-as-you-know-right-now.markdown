Having had a lot of conversations with people over the last couple of weeks on strategies that have worked in my life to help ensure that I maintained my focus, I thought I would share a tip that my Dad gave me a long time ago.

<strong>'There will always be someone who knows more than you do' </strong>

Such a simple phrase, but it has had a huge impact on the way that I, in my own life, have dealt with the issue of personal development. If I don't have to worry about 'keeping up with the Joneses' that means that I can truly focus on improving myself for the sake of personal satisfaction and nothing else. I can be free from playing technology monopoly and only take a look at bringing on board technologies if and when I see a role and advantage to be gained by integrating them into my work.

I can read blogs by people who are doing cool stuff and have it be an empowering thing and not a stumbling block to my own creativity. If I know as much as I know right now, I will know more tomorrow. Why? Because now the only person I need to challenge is myself. I can leverage the skills of people I have been surrounded by to be my sounding board for potentially wacky ideas that I come up with. The whole time, I am honing my craft and expanding the way my mind looks at solving problems that it is presented with.
