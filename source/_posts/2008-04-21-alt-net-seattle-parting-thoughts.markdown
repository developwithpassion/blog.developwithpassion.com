This past Alt.Net experience was amazing as always. I am continually blown away by the level of passion that is exhibited by all attendees. Every single person in attendance comes ready to share and learn.  
I enjoyed talking with a lot of new faces and spending (too short) time with friends that I have not seen for a while.  
It is particularly awesome for me to see the growth that is occurring in people as I reconnect with them after 1 year of not chatting with them. It is truly amazing the distance a person can travel with a bit of focus and determination.  
Even though the conference was going on, I got to spend a considerable amount of time with my family also. On the evening of the second night, we went out to go and see the Forbidden Kingdom with Jackie Chan and Jet Li. The movie was excellent, and served as a great way to break up the Alt .Net event for me.  
If you are thinking about attending an Alt.Net event, I encourage you to not hesitate to attend/organize one in your local area. This is not a community of people who think they are better, it is a community of people who are continually trying to become better software developers. The ideas and thoughts are an aggregate of concepts that are not yet considered mainstream by a majority of the .Net community. It is particularly encouraging for me to see the increased level of Microsoft involvement at each successive Alt .Net event.  
I made a comment that it was particularly interesting that the venue (Digipen) happens to be one of the leaders in churning out top quality innovative game developers. The perfect place to host a group of people who are striving for innovation and creativity with respect to problem solving in the software realm.  
Hopefully I will see some of you at an Alt .Net event in the future!!  
Develop with Passion!!
