After almost a half year away from home, the traveling Boodhoo wagon is making its way back to Calgary. Contrary to popular belief, we did not setup shop in Austin. We have unfinished business to attend to in Calgary, and will be staying there until the end of April. At that time we will be heading off on the road again for more travels.

I have been making note of our journey and destinations this past year and will blog a quick summary post of our travels next week once we arrive back in Canada!!

It has been a truly amazing journey for our family, and we truly feel blessed to have been able to have the opportunity to undertake these travels, meet so many amazing people, and see so many amazing things.

God Is Good!!
