My response rate to emails for the last year has been less than stellar. This was mostly due to the fact that I did not really have a good way of managing requests that came in. So instead of trying to manage it incrementally, I often opted for the “ignore” option.  
That stops today. As of this morning I put the following auto responder on my gmail account (Canned Response is a great gmail labs feature):  
<em>In an effort to increase productivity and efficiency I am beginning a new personal email policy. </em>  
<em>I will only be checking email at 4pm on weekdays. I will try and respond to email in a timely manner (no earlier than the morning of the next business day) without neglecting the needs of my clients.</em>  
<em>If you need to get in contact with me urgently please don’t hesitate to call me on my phone, the number is available on my</em><a href="http://www.developwithpassion.com"><em> public website</em></a><em> , I much rather enjoy phone conversations anyway!! </em>  
<em>Thanks for your anticipated understanding!!</em>  
<em>God Bless You</em>
