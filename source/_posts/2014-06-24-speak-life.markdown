Our message series for this year in Church is all about "Mountains will move".

One of the aspects that our pastor has talked about in the last couple of weeks (event though I've missed quite a bit this year!) is speaking to our mountains.

Our words have power, God's word says:

{% blockquote Bible, Proverbs 18:21  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+18:21 %}
The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.
{% endblockquote %}

When we choose to use our words to speak life into people as opposed to tearing them down, we can literally transform a heart.

This [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBv9r92VQ0) is an awesome song that reminds me of the impact that "Speaking Life" can have.
