There have been several groups of people who have got in contact with me to let me know about problems they have been having with the course registration process. The limitation right now is a PayPal issue. They are unable to allow transactions larger than $4000 USD.   
This is not a problem for people who are registering sole attendees. It is, however, a problem if you are trying to register more than one person at a time.   
For the interim, if you need to register a group of people I would ask that you kindly register each attendee one at a time. This situation will be remedied in about a month when we will be switching to a custom solution that will not have these limitations. Until that rolls out I kindly ask for your patience and understanding in the matter.   
I assure you that steps are being taken to rectify the situation as quickly as possible!!   
Develop With Passion!!
