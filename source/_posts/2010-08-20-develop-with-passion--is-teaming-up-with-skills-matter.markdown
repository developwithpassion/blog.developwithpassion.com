In 2 weeks I will be coming back to the UK to deliver another iteration of [Nothin But .Net](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo). The turnout for the upcoming class is excellent, and I am greatly looking forward to sharing that week with a group of people eager and hungry to learn!!

Over a month ago I finished discussions with [Skills matter](http://skillsmatter.com), and have agreed to collaborate on delivering some training in the UK a little more than once a year. This means that along with the 1 time a year that I come to the UK independently, Skills Matter will also be offering the Nothin But .Net course a couple of other times during the year.

This means that along with the course that I am delivering in 2 weeks. I will be coming back to the UK this year to deliver another course during the week of November 8th.

If you were hoping to take part in the course but were unable to attend the course in 2 weeks, this could be a great opportunity to take part later on this year.

To register for the course you can signup [here](http://skillsmatternbdnnovember2010.eventbrite.com/).
