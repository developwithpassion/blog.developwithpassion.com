Back in December I recorded a [podcast](http://polymorphicpodcast.com/shows/digital-life/) with [Craig Shoemaker](http://weblogs.asp.net/craigshoemaker/) of the [Polymorphic Podcast](http://polymorphicpodcast.com/). We had a discussion about tools and techniques that I used to stay productive while on the road. Even if you don't find yourself doing a lot of travelling, lots of the tricks/tools we discussed could be things that you may find useful.   
Develop With Passion!!
