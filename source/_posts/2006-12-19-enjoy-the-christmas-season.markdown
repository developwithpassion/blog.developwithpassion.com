I have been pretty quiet the last month or two (and for good reason!!). I 
have a new gameplan in place for next year along with a couple of new 
developments that I will talk about in 2007.

I am going to take the rest of the year off from blogging, and will resume at 
a more frequent pace in the new year. Needless to say, over the last couple of 
months I have amassed a wealth of info that I would love to share with the 
community. The majority of this sharing will take place in the form of 
presentations, mentoring engagements, and training sessions, and articles.

My presentation schedule for the month of January 2007 looks as follows:
<ul><li>January 9th - Recording DNRTV episode on Design Patterns (could turn into a 
series if there is enough interest).</li><li>January 10th - Lunch and Learn session in Calgary (not sure of location yet) 
on Enterprise Patterns</li><li>January 27th - Victoria Code Camp</li></ul>

If you live in Calgary or Victoria, I look forward to seeing you out at one 
of the presentations.

I pray that you have an amazing Christmas with your friends and family.

 

See you next year.
