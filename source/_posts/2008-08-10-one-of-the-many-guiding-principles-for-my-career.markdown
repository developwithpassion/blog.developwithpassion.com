I often talk with people about the many great life lessons that I have learned from reading the Bible. There is one verse in particular that I share with people when it comes to my attitude toward work. I personally believe that this verse has been something that has always allowed me to receive amazing satisfaction from the jobs I have been blessed to receive. The verse is Colossians 3:23 - 24:
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica"><em><strong>"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving."</strong></em>
