Well, tonight I had an awesome time giving an information filled presentation to the Regina .Net User Group. The venue was awesome and I was pleasantly surprised by the number of people that showed up. The presentation started at 6:30PM and went strong until 8:30PM. 
There were not a lot of questions, but the ratings and comments from the attendees was awesome. It is always great to receive a mixture of both positive and negative feedback. I am constantly reminded by others, as well as myself, that I sometimes try to cover too much stuff in one presentation. I have a bit of a tendency to ramble!!
