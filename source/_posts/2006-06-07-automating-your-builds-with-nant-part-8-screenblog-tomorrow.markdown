This is a note out for all of the people who have been following along in the [NAnt starter series](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/NAntStarterSeries.aspx), that tomorrow I will be posting one of the final entries in this series. This episode will be all about getting a Continuous Build environment set up with CruiseControl .Net. Topics that are going to be covered are:
<ul>
<li>Installing Cruise Control .Net</li>
<li>Setting up the build box for project building</li>
<li>Creating the repository</li>
<li>Configuring the build box to build the project</li>
<li>Integration with CC.Net</li></ul>



That is a high level overview. As you can imagine, it is a lot of information, too much for me to write about (in a practical amount of time). This is why I am going to do a screencast on my computer that will be made available for everyone to watch. One thing you will want to do is read my [Applied Test Driven Development For Web ApplicationsPart1](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/AppliedTestDrivenDevelopmentForWebApplicationsPart1.aspx) post and download the sample code as that is what you will need to follow along with the screen cast. I am choosing to use that code base as it will be the code base that will be build upon in the Applied Test Driven Development series, where we will build out a web application (against the adventureworks database) using TDD techniques.

After watching the video you will have a great starting point from which to start practically using CC.Net in your own environment. To save yourself some time I suggest going to download CC.Net from [here](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ccnet/CruiseControl.NET-1.0.1-Setup.exe?download). You don't need to install it yet, as I will walk through the install process tomorrow!!
