Just got an email from a man named Michael Hunger. It looks like he has been busy compiling and creating resources focused around the arena of "Creating Passionate Developers". I have not had a lot of time to look at the information, but I am developing 100% behind the message!!  
Check out the following resources:  <ul>   <li>[Michael's Web Site](http://www.jexp.de)</li>    <li>[Creating Passionate Developers](http://creating.passionate-developers.org)</li> </ul>  
Develop With Passion!!
