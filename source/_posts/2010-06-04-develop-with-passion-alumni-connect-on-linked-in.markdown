It has now been 3 years since I made the decision to start offering training courses that I could use a a means to engage, educate, and empower people to take their careers to the next level. I have lost count of the number of students that I have been blessed to be able to train over the years!!
 
One thing that I have always wanted to do a better job with, but as of yet have been unable to follow up on, is keeping the conversation going between past students. I am not talking about the conversation between myself and them, more importantly the conversation between each other.

To that end, I just recently set up a[ Develop With Passion™ - Alumni](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=3101770&trk=myg_ugrp_ovr) group on linked in. The goal is (for the interim) to have a place where past students can come and share their war stories, talk about challenges, offer encouragement, and all sorts of other hopefully great things.

This is a post to encourage past students who have not yet responded to the invite to head over to the group, sign up, and start contributing. I know there is lots that we can all learn from one another!!
