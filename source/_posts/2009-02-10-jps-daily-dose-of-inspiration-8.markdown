Do you still remember the dreams you had for yourself when you were younger? Are you currently chasing them, or have you placed them on the “bookshelf” to be revisited at a time that feels more suitable? Your dreams are achievable. Sometime it requires venturing out of the harbour of the “known and safe”. Although it can sometimes seem scary taking those first steps into the unknown, the results can often be far more amazing than anything you could imagine. Dare to live a positive dream today. I am going to leave you thinking about the words from the awesome [Switchfoot](http://www.switchfoot.com/) song “this is your life”:  
<em>Yesterday is a wrinkle on your forehead     
Yesterday is a promise that you�ve broken      
Don�t close your eyes, don�t close your eyes      
This is your life and today is all you�ve got now      
Yeah, and today is all you�ll ever have      
Don�t close your eyes      
Don�t close your eyes</em>  
   
<em>This is your life, are you who you want to be     
This is your life, are you who you want to be      
This is your life, is it everything you dreamed that it would be      
When the world was younger and you had everything to lose</em>  
  
Are you who you want to be? If not, start making steps to do something about it.
