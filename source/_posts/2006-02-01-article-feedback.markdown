Just a quick shout out to all those who took the time to read and respond to a recent article I published in visual studio magazine. It is great to hear positive (and negative) feeback from any public offering, and I greatly appreciate the time people took to let me know the pros and cons to the article that I delivered. I am looking forward to hopefully publishing more content as time goes by.

 

Thanks once again.
