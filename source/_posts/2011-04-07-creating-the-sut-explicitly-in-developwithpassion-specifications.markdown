There will be times when you will want to explicilty specify how the SUT should be created when you are inheriting from either of the following classes:

* Observes< SUT >
* Observes< Contract , SUT >

To accomplish this you need to leverage the following block of code in the Establish block for your context:

{% codeblock lang:csharp %}
  sut_factory.create_using(factory);
{% endcodeblock %}

Factory will be of type SUTFactory<SUT> which is bascially just a delegate type that takes no arguments and returns an instance of the system under test.

Most likely you will be using it as follows:

{% codeblock lang:csharp %}
  sut_factory.create_using(() => new Calculator()) 
{% endcodeblock %}

Hope this helps out!!
