My amazingly talented sister just released a new single on itunes. It is titled "Wherever you are".\   
A great thing about this single (aside for the fact that it is an awesome song) is that proceeds from the single will go toward the girls leadership institute in the US.   
Check out the song and purchase it to support this great cause!
