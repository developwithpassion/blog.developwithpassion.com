This is just a note to let people know that the schedule for 2009 has been penciled in and not yet posted. My hope was to get to provide my web site with some much needed TLC and that has not happened. Courses will start up again in May 2009 and run until December 2009. So far the countries that are on the list are:  <ul>   <li>Canada</li>    <li>USA</li>    <li>England</li>    <li>Australia</li>    <li>Germany</li>    <li>India/Cambodia (need to talk with more people before this is finalized)</li> </ul>  
That is just the high level country list, not the city list. My wife and I are finalizing the schedule and even without posting it to the schedule page, there will be a post that outlines that actual destinations within the next 2 weeks. One of the plans for next year (late next year) is to also launch a new course targeting the development and delivery of smart client applications. Nothin But .Net has typically been delivered targeting web developers, this new course would be focused on strategies for building composable Smart Client applications. The majority of my development career has been in the smart client space, and since I have not shared a lot of information on the techniques I use, it would be the perfect venue to share a lot of techniques and strategies I use. My hope is to beta the course late next year, and have a Q4 2009 first offering, or at the latest a Q1 2010 offering.  
At the end of the day this is just a heads up that courses will be continuing for next year and if you are planning on attending, stay tuned.  
Develop With Passion!!
