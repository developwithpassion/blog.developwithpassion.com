Well, its been quite a long time since I have given a formal presentation!!

The guys at [camug](http://www.meetup.com/Calgary-Agile-Methods-User-Group/events/87125652/) graciously asked if I would be interested in coming to give a small 4 hour intro to the Ruby programming language.

I am going to keep the concepts as simple as possible; and treat it as a basic introduction to the ruby programming language in the context of building a simple, but fun, application.

The presentation is completely free so if you are interested in attending you have to:

* Register for the event at the camug site (there are only 25 spots available)
* Show up next Saturday morning with you laptop in tow, so that you can code along and have the concepts solidify in your head.

##Software Requirements

* Windows Based OS
  * Install the latest version of Ruby using the [RubyInstaller](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/76527/rubyinstaller-1.9.3-p286.exe)

* Unix Based OS (OSX/Linux)
  * Install the most current version of [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/), using the instructions on its site.

Regardless of which environment you come with, make sure that you have it configured correctly and can run a basic ruby file from your console. I would also recommend that you have a good text editor at the ready to code along during the presentation.


If there are still spots available, come out for what I pray will be a fun even for all involved!!!
