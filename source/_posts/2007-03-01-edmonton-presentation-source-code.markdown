I had a blast presenting at the Edmonton .Net User Group last week. With the presentation and finishing the course I neglected to upload the source code for the presentation. 
It is a little rough around the edges, but the cool part was that almost all of the code was churned out during the course of the session. It was a frenzy, but I feel confident that a lot of awesome concepts got disseminated to the crowd. 
Thanks Edmonton for having me, I look forward to the next time. 
You can download the source code from [here]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/2007/march/01/edmontonPresentationSourceCode/demo.rar) (you will need [WinRar](http://www.rarlab.com/) to extract it).
