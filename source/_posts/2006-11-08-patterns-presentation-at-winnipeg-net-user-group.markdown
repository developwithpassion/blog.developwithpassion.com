Last night I had the awesome honor of presenting at the Winnipeg .Net User Group. The presentation was an introduction to design patterns, with the final example stetching into a 400 - 500 level implementation. 
There were awesome questions generated, and I got to meet and hand out with some awesome people. 
Next and final stop on the mini tour, Saskatoon.
