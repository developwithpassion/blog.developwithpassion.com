On the 17th of July I will be giving one of my last public speaking presentations for the foreseeable future. I will be presenting a Generics session at the [Orlando .Net User Group](http://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=NmpnN2dpc3B1Mm5hZzZtYTQzODdzYzdpcDAgb21kYXRuaDB1YmNyaWlrdmdwMWhkcjJxZDBAZw&ctz=America/New_York).

Expect to see some practical and pragmatic uses of generics in the realm of application development.

If you happen to be in and around the area that evening stop by, I am sure a fun time will be had by all!!

Develop With Passion
