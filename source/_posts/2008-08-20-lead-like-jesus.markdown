I am currently in the midst of reading an amazing book titled [Lead Like Jesus](http://www.amazon.com/Lead-Like-Jesus-Greatest-Leadership/dp/0849900409). I just read a great paragraph that I feel called to share:  
  
"Acting out of pride is like trying to blow up a balloon with a hole in it. It is lonely business requiring consistent effort with only temporary results that never satisfy or please anyone. Think of a time when you have blew up a balloon and there was a hole in it, and you will have a good mental image of what happens when you put your self-esteem in your performance and the opinions of others."  
  
Currently I am only 1/4 way through the book, but I am already aware of the fact that the book is going to have a tremendous impact on me!!  
  
Develop With Passion!!
