If you have not yet downloaded a copy of the [4.5 EAP](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.5+Nightly+Builds) I suggest that you go now and give it a whirl.  
So far everything is looking good. One of my favorite additions so far is the modified naming style page:  
 <a href="{{ site.cdn_root }}binary/WindowsLiveWriter/ReSharper4.5EAP_14B07/image_2.png" rel="lightbox"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="508" alt="image" src="{{ site.cdn_root }}binary/WindowsLiveWriter/ReSharper4.5EAP_14B07/image_thumb.png" width="508" border="0" /></a>   
Notice how most of my Entity kinds settings are set to “all_lower”. This is awesome, because now ReSharper will suggest underscored member names for me all over the place. It is a small addition but great.  
  
Develop With Passion!!
