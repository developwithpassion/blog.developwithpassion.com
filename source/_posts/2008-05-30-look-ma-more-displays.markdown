[VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) 2.0 Beta just released and they finally have support for something I have been missing for a while since switching to the wonderful world of WOM (Windows On Mac), multi-monitor support.  
Finally I can run my VM and stretch it across an many displays as my mac can physically handle!!! Now realistically, for me that just means my Monitor and the MacBook Pro LCD, but it is still better than nothing!!
