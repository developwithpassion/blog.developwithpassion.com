After a lot of thought, I have decided that from now on I am going to publish the videos on this site in two formats:
<ul>
<li>A torrent file that will contain the full flash movie and accompanying source code. You could then use a standalone flash player like [Swiff](http://www.globfx.com/products/swfplayer/) to watch the movie on your local machine.</li></ul>

The torrent for the Applied Test Driven Development - Part 1 (Video) can be found [here]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/appliedTestDrivenDevelopmentForWebApplicationsPart2//AppliedTestDrivenDevelopmentPart2.torrent). I have already received some kind offers from people who would like to seed the files also. If you are able to that would be greatly appreciated.
