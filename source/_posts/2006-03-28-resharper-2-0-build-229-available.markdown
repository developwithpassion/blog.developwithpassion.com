That's right. The good folks at [Jetbrains ](http://www.jetbrains.com/) continue to keep this product moving forward. Yes, there is not an official release yet, but the build keeps getting better and better. If you haven't used ReSharper, I seriously recommend you [download ](http://jetbrains.net/confluence/display/resharper/download) the latest build and give it a whirl.
