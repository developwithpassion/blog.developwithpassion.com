A good friend suggested that “seeing your name at the top of all my tests is weird”!! To that end I am rebranding all of my common libraries to be prefixed with the develop with passion label. I have really put this framework through its paces and am really happy with the way that it allows me to write tests.  
You can read about it on the following blog posts (just replace every occurrence of jpboodhoo with developwithpassion!!):  <ul>   <li>[More new conventions for how I organize my tests](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/MoreNewConventionsForHowIOrganizeMyTests.aspx)</li>    <li>[using jpboodhoo.bdd developwithpassion.bdd with TestDriven.Net](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/UsingJpboodhoobddWithTestDrivenNet.aspx)</li>    <li>[Slight addition to jpboodhoo.bdd developwithpassion.bdd](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/SlightAdditionToJpboodhoobdd.aspx)</li>    <li>[Scott wrote about Getting Started With Boodhoo BDD developwithpassion.bdd](http://sleepoverrated.com/archive/2009/01/getting-started-with-boodhoo-bdd/)</li> </ul>
