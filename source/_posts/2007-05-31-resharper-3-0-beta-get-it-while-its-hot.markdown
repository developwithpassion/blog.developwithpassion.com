I've been using ReSharper 3.0 EAP for quite some time now, and I'm loving it. The beta just released (yesterday I think), so what are you waiting for:
<ul>
<li>Solution Wide Error Analysis</li>
<li>C# Code Analysis</li>
<li>Unit Test Explorer</li>
<li>XAML Support</li>
<li>More...</li></ul>

[Download](http://download.jetbrains.com/resharper/ReSharperSetup.3.0.beta.msi)<font color="#0066cc"> </font>it right now and start developing with pleasure!!
