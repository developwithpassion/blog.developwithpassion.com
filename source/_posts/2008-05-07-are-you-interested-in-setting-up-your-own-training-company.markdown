The title of this post alludes to a topic I thought I would go about sharing with people. Having seen the success of the [Nothin But .Net](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training/courseschedule.aspx) series of courses (Lord willing, that will continue!!) I am firmly in the trenches of believing that grassroots, independent training is a very successful model for delivering top quality training material to people all over the world.

I am not going to spend time crafting this post unless there is significant interest (as you can imagine, I have lots of other stuff to do). If there is interest I thought I would share some of the things that I have learned over the course of the last 1.5 years.

I have definitely learned a lot of lessons, and made a lot of mistakes!! If there are any words of wisdom that I can potentially pass onto other people who are looking at branching out into training, then I will gladly share them!!

Develop With Passion!!
