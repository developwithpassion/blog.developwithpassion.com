The current issue of Code magazine is focused on the application of agile practices.

I had the honor of being included with some very well respected developers in the Agile space and contributed a small MVP Corner article titled: [Individuagility](http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0805021).

The article is a bullet list of steps that an individual developer can take to start down the road of improving their craft. It is a list that I have been able to apply in mentorship scenarios with great success. I am sure that there are other points that I could have mentioned, but you need to consider it one of many routes to arrive at the same destination: A desire for continued improvement in the realm of software development.

While you are reading the current issue of Code make sure you check out all of the other amazing articles that can serve as a great way for people to expose themselves to ideas that they may not yet be familiar/comfortable with.

Develop with Passion!!
