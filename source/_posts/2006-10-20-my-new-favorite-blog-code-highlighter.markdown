For the longest time I have been using [Actipro Code Highlighter](http://www.actiprosoftware.com/Products/DotNet/CodeHighlighter/PasteCode.aspx) to do my code highlighting for my blog posts. It is free and it does an awesome job. Lately I have been using a [Live Writer plugin written by Douglas Stockwell](http://11011.net/archives/000656.html). Now it is as easy as copy my code in visual studio and pasting it into Live Writer (with the use of a menu item). 
Just download the zip file and extract it to your Windows Live Writer plugins directory, and you are off to the races. Thanks Doug.
