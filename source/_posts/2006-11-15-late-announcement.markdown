Seeing as how this is a personal announcement, I shouldn't be surprised that I did not announce this sooner. Last week my wife and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary!! At 28 (we got married right out of high school) and 4 kids later, we have been blessed beyond measure. 
Here are a couple of tips that have really helped us solidify a strong relationship: <ul> <li>Talk about everything</li> <li>Compromise</li> <li>Remember that it's not all about "you"</li> <li>Pray together</li> <li>Laugh together</li> <li>Set goals together and work together to achieve them</li> <li>Don't hide from conflict</li> <li>Cuddle Lots</li></ul> 
I could keep on listing these, but I don't want this post to turn into "Tips for a successful marriage". 
The main point was to shout out this personal milestone that we both feel extremely blessed to have achieved.
