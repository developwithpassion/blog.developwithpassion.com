[Develop With Passion®][dwp] has teamed up with [Skills Matter][sm] to deliver a handful of extra [nbdn][nbdn] courses in the UK each year. The first course is scheduled to be held in November 2010.

As it stands right now, there are no people registered for the November course. Both [skills matter][sm] and myself have agreed that if there are not 8 registrants signed up by 4 weeks prior to the course, it will be cancelled.

If you know of people who may be interested in attending the course feel free to let them know about the upcoming course in November.
