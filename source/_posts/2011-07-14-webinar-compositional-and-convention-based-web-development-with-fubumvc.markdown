## Session Overview
[FubuMVC](http://fubumvc.com) is a .NET open-source front-controller MVC web
framework. Fubu (which stands for "for us, by us") focuses on rapid development,
pluggability, and convention-based configuration. It tries to focus on SOLID
principles, composability, separation of concerns, DRY, and other critical
concepts of rapid, frictionless and pain-free web development. There are several
differentiating features from ASP.NET MVC, such as behavior chains, packaging,
routing conventions, HTML conventions, and much more.
  
## Agenda  
  
* Starting Bare Bones from the FubuMVC NuGet package  
* Exploring the Getting Started Sample from the FubuMVC Guides  
* Configuring Routes via Conventions  
* View Location and Discovery  
* Clean Controller Actions with Behavior Chains  
* HTML Markup Generated By View Model Conventions  
* Ultimate Modularity with Packages (Bottles)
