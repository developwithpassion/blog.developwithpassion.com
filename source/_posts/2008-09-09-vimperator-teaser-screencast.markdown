As promised, I have created a quick <5 minute screencast that demonstrates the use of [Vimperator](http://vimperator.mozdev.org/) to achieve mouseless browsing.  
This is my first screencast recorded using [ScreenFlow](http://www.flip4mac.com/screenflow.htm) and I have to say that I am extremely impressed with the product!! I made sure to turn on the displaying of all keys and CTRL keys so that you could see exactly what I was pressing!!  
Right now there is problems publishing comments to my blog, so if you have any feedback to provide please direct it to my email address at:  
[jp@developwithpassion.com](mailto:jp@developwithpassion.com)  
Some of the other tools that you see used in the screencast are:  <ul>   <li>[QuickSilver](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/22549)</li>    <li>[Macvim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/)</li>    <li>[ItsAllText](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125)</li> </ul>  
While watching the video keep in mind that I did not interact with the mouse for the entire movie!!  
The movie is in QuickTime format, and you can download it from here:  <ul>   <li>[Movie]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/2008/september/9/vimperator_teaser_screencast/vimperator_teaser.mov)</li> </ul>  
Develop With Passion!!
