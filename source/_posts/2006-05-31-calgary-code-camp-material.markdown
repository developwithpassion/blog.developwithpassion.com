I have uploaded the demo and slide deck for the presentation that I delivered at the Calgary Code Camp this past weekend. The presentation was all about 3 key principles:
<ul>
<li>Test Driven Development</li>
<li>Dependency Inversion principle (yes inversion not injection)</li>
<li>Dependency Injection</li></ul>

I am going to try to make time to re-record the session on my laptop so that I can put it up for others to view. If you have any questions about the slide deck or the demo, please do not hesitate to contact me.
