Everyone who knows me will know that I can tend to ramble on about the topic of this post. I am a big proponent of trying to encourage people to stretch and really push to achieve dreams that they have identified that they want to see come to fruition.

I could ramble on about this topic and share my own thoughts and ideas with respect to how I personally went about making dreams a reality for myself and my family; instead I would like to share [a video presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo) from an amazing computer science professor named [Randy Pausch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Pausch).

I can't stress enough the importance of outlook with respect to approaching every situation. This man is dying of pancreatic cancer and he still has a passion and fire that he wants to use to light up the lives of the people that he comes into contact with.

Though I don't agree with all of the points that he makes in the video, the man is truly an inspirational teacher, and the life lessons he has learned to get to where he is are truly awesome.

I have to say a special thanks to Perry Neal for taking the time to send me the link. I watched the video on my second monitor at work, and then went home that same evening and watched it again with my wife.

Three points in the video really stuck a chord with me and I hope they will resonate with you long after you watch the video:
<ul>
  <li>Brick walls are not only there to make us realize how much we want to achieve a goal, they are also there to keep out the others who are not willing to break through to their achievements.</li>

  <li>You have to decide whether you are a Tigger or an Eeyore. Your outlook on life and the situations that you are placed in will greatly affect the outcome and potential realization of your own dreams.</li>

  <li>As someone who wants to impact kids with respect to getting them fired up about potential careers in software, the [ALICE](http://www.alice.org/) program looks like a phenomenal resource.</li>
</ul>

This video is an absolute must see, and I think you could potentially look at transforming your life if you allow some of the ideas and techniques this man is sharing to permeate your very core!!

Enjoy.
