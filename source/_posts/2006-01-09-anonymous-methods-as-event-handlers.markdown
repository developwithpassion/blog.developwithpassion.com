Thought I would try something different and show a video of how you can use anonymous methods as event handlers. This is my first try at using screen recording software for this purpose. If it proves successful and popular then I will probably make a video posting or 2 every month.

<div><a href="#" onclick="javascript:window.open('{{ site.cdn_root }}binary/anonymousMethodsAsEventHandlers/AnonymousMethodsAsEventHandlers.html',null,
		'height=810,width=1030,status=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,location=no')">Click here to watch the movie.</a></div>
    
Enjoy
