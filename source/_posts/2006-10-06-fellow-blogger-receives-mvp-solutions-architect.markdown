One of my Canadian cohorts, [James Kovacs](http://www.jameskovacs.com), has just received a MVP - Visual Studio Solutions Architect. James has been speaking in and around Calgary (and surrounding cities) for quite some time. He is a very knowledgeable .Net guy, and an all around nice person!! 
Congrats James, it has been a long time coming!!
