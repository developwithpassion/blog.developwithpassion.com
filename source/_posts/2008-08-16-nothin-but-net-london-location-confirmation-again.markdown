I seem to be having some trouble with my blog posting software. Here it goes again!  
The venue for the course has been changed to the [London Marriott Hotel Regents Park](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lonrp-london-marriott-hotel-regents-park/).   
The evening rates for people wishing to stay at this hotel are around 118 GBP a night.   
You can register for the course here: [http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaID=164699](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaID=164699)  
Develop With Passion!!
