Well you can officially call me a Vim junkie now!! Having spent the last couple of weeks working with it I can definitely say that I would not work at a machine that did not have it. That's right, that is the same claim I made, and still make, about [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/). I still trip myself up in ReSharper with VIM a couple of times, but nothing worth writing home about. To ensure a complete immersion, I have purchased a copy of [Vimemu](http://www.viemu.com/) that integrates with:  <ul>   <li>Visual Studio 2008/2005</li>    <li>Microsoft Word</li>    <li>Microsoft Outlook</li> </ul>  
As well as now using gvim as my primary text editor (notepad++ is still in the picture) I just recently installed [Vimperator](http://vimperator.mozdev.org/) which plugs into firefox to give me a whole world of Vim goodness.  
There is only one problem with getting used to this tool - You will start wishing you had Vim integration into all of your applications!!!!!  
For those of you who are curious, you might get a kick out of the following article:  
[Why, oh WHY, do those #?@! nutheads use vi?](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html)  
As soon as I have time I am going to give a screencast on using all of these tools.
