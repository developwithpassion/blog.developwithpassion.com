Just finished reading an excellent [blogpost ](http://rasmusson.wordpress.com/2008/01/25/your-project-is-already-dead-%e2%80%93-you-just-don%e2%80%99t-know-it/) by [Jonathan Rasmusson](http://rasmusson.wordpress.com/). I think we can all identify with a lot of the information in this post!!

This is a good post that you can forward to your PM if you think they have a false sense of security about what is going on in their project!!
