I am happy to announce that Develop With Passion® is adding a new course to its roster of kick butt one of a kind developer training. [Develop With Passion® - Gamecrash Bootcamp](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training/game_crash) is a course focused on taking traditional developers with no prior experience in game programming and having them come out at the end of the week with the fundamental skills required to build games.

As all Develop With Passion® courses, the primary focus will be on the fundamentals. We want to give you the core tools that you can use to apply in any environment that you may consider building games.

As time permits I will make myself available to deliver this course also, but this brings me to the other part of this exciting announcement!

The primary instructor for this course is going to be [Jon Beltran de Heredia](http://jonbho.net/), who many of you know as the creator of the fantastic [ViEmu](http://www.viemu.com/). Jon has a long history with game programming, being the lead programmer for Commandos and Commandos 2, and has deep experience with all aspects of game development.

We are very excited to have Jon on board with Develop With Passion®, and can't wait to have a whole new set of students get "put through the wringer"!!

Please join me in welcoming Jon to the Develop With Passion® team and Gamecrash to the awesome lineup of courses that Develop With Passion® is continuing to grow.
