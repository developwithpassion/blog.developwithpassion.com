After talking with a lot of people who have been unable to successfully download Part 1 of the TDD series, I decided I would post a link where people can download the first video again. 
In order to watch this movie (offline), you will need to make sure you download the [Swiff Player](http://www.globfx.com/products/swfplayer/), for offline viewing of the flash movie. 
I know it has been a while since the first video. I have finished recording the second movie and will be posting it in a couple of days to give people a chance to get back into the rhythm of where things will be going. 
You can download the movie [here (right click and Save As, if you want to save it to your hard drive).]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/appliedTestDrivenDevelopmentForWebApplicationsPart2/AppliedTestDrivenDevelopmentPart1.swf) 
During the course of these episodes you will be exposed to different ways of utilizing TDD practices along with tools that support TDD. If you do not have it already, you should download a copy of [ReSharper 2.0](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) to follow along with what I am doing!!
