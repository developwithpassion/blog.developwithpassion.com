Thanks to everyone who has provided awesome feedback to the current set of posts and screencast. My family and I are going on vacation tomorrow; so this will most likely be my last post for the next 2 weeks. I am making a request for people who are either following along with the screencast or interested in applying TDD to do the following:
<ul>
<li>Submit requests for features you would like to see implemented in the sample application</li>
<li>Submit aspx pages (no codebehind), that contain layouts for a screen(s) you want to see implemented using TDD</li>
<li>High level client centric use cases</li></ul>

Here are my reasonings for this request. I have been practicing TDD for 3 years. I have been involved in the development of many applications of all shapes and sizes and technologies utilizing TDD methods. Unfortunately, I can't bring most of you with me onto these projects (although you could bring me onto yours!!). Instead of me coming up with fictitious scenarios and features, I am counting on my readers to take the place of the client and help drive out the functionality of this 'fictitious!!' application. With the submission of high-level use cases, combined (hopefully) with screen prototypes; this provides us with a scenario which is typical of well-run agile environments. A majority of the projects I have worked on have followed this approach, going so far as having the analysts creating screen mockups using plain old powerpoint!! Once the screen mockups and high level use cases are in hand, I can take the use case and break it down into measurable tasks that will become focal points for driving out small pieces of functionality using TDD.

I want this series of podcasts to become one of the places where people who are interested in seeing TDD practically applied to turn to. To do that successfully I need to depend on my readership to help drive the direction of the project. That way I will be providing information that will hopefully convey TDD in a meaningful,pragmatic way.

Thanks and get those requests in!!
