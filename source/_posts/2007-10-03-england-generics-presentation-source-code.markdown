Back on the 17th of September, the good folks at the NxtGenUG in Oxford, England were kind enough to extend me [an invitation to speak](http://www.nxtgenug.net/ViewEvent.aspx?EventID=82).

The presentation went well and I promised to make the code available as soon as I could. Looks like it took me a little bit longer than I planned!!

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to come and share. It was awesome to be back in England!!
