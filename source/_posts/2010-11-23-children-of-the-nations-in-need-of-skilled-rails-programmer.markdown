[Children of the Nations][cotn] is a Christian ministry that partners with foreign nationals; to provide holistic, Christ-centered care for orphaned and destitute children, enabling them to create positive and lasting change in their nations. It recently celebrated its 15th anniversary. They currently help children in Uganda, Sierra Leone, Malawi, and the Dominican Republic; they are in the process of researching expansion into Haiti and Liberia.

Recently their sole computer programmer moved on; which has left a gap that now needs to be filled by someone who would want to contribute their programming efforts to this awesome cause.

Ideally, they are looking for someone who:

* Loves the Lord
* Is able to work in a full time capacity
* Is skilled with Ruby and Rails
