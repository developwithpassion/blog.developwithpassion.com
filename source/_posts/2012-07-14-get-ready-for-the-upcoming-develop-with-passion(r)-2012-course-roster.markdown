I am in the last 2 months of an awesome contract that I was blessed to work on this year. We are now getting prepared for what I am sure is going to be an amazing lineup of courses, to be held over the remainder of the 2012 calendar year.

Along with a set of tried and tested: Develop With Passion® - .Net Bootcamps, this year I am also going to be launching a Develop With Passion® - Ruby Bootcamp! In the same vein as the .Net bootcamp, this course will be a deep dive into advanced fundamentals of software engineering using Ruby as the delivery language mechanism. Over the course of the week, you will learn the ins an out of design patterns, software engineering, automated testing and builds, all while trying to build a Rails clone from the ground up. If you are wanting yet another course that will teach you how to use Rails - well, this one won't be for you. This is a course that (like
the .Net bootcamp) is geared at making you a much better software developer overall. Of course we will dive into some pretty awesome usages of the language and it capabilities, but first and foremost these bootcamps are all about giving you a solid foundation with which you can use to propel your software goals to new heights.

One of the biggest changes I am personally making to the courses (based off of a couple of years worth of feedback now) is the addition of slide decks to complement the material that is covered. This has traditionally been a very code focused course set, with the majority of the five 12 hours days that make up a course week revolving around cutting code! That focus is not changing, but it is now going to be augmented with a set of material that will cater to the visual learners.

The automation for the course over the years has become really smooth. With [GitHub](http://github.com) being used as a central component for both versioning our changes, as well as rapidly switching between different views on a problem. Even if you have no git experience, the automation scripts that are setup for the course allow people to keep moving smoothly without git inexperience getting in the way.

Course weeks are recorded in ScreenFlow screencasting software, and students are able to copy the screencasts from me at the end of the course week.

Over the course of the past 4 years I have been blessed to be able to travel the world with my family and deliver this course to over 1500 people. Over that time, I have had the benefit of identifying patterns and practices of effective development that I have both observed from people I have worked with as well as effective devs who have taken the training course. My main personal goals for anyone attending one of the Develop With Passion® courses are as follows:

1. Provide you with approaches, resources, and examples that can help turn you into an amazing coder.
2. Give inspiration and insight that can help you set bigger goals both professionally and more importantly, personally.
3. Help you to remember why you became a coder in the first place.

Don't take my word for it, here is a sampling of comments made by past students (good and bad!, sorry for the age of the links, collecting reviews has definitely been a weak point!):
