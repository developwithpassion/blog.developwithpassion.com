Seeing as how my daily work ritual for the last couple of months has been to startup my machine and pull down and install the latest version of ReSharper, I found it pleasantly surprising to see the addition to the install dialog this morning:  
  
<a href="{{ site.cdn_root }}binary/WindowsLiveWriter/RunningOnTheTrunk_85A2/image_2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="431" alt="image" src="{{ site.cdn_root }}binary/WindowsLiveWriter/RunningOnTheTrunk_85A2/image_thumb.png" width="438" border="0" /></a>

Develop With Passion!!
