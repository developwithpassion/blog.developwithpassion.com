For all of you who are not too keen on installing EAP software, the wait is finally over. Jetbrains has now announced the official beta for ReSharper 2.0. In case you are not aware of ReSharper, it is an add-in that dramatically improves the usability of Visual Studio, from a coder's perspective. Basically, once you are used to developing with ReSharper you will find yourself hard pressed to go back to plain old VS2005. If you have not yet given ReSharper a try, I encourage you to download a copy of the beta and give it a whirl!! There is also an incentive to purchase a copy of 1.5 now, and get a free upgrade to 2.0 when it becomes officially available in May.
