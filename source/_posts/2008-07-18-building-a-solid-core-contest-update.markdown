Apparently my plan of posting the top entries for the contest has been delayed a little. There have been plenty of awesome entries received (they are all great). Look for the top 5 entries to be posted next week, and the voting will begin.

Thank you to all who have submitted entries, your stories are truly awesome!!

Develop With Passion!!
