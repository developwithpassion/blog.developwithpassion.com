Sorry for the late notice, but I thought I should quickly mention (for anyone who lives in/near Edmonton) that I have been graciously invited to come at speak at the new [Edmonton .Net Users Group.](http://www.edmug.net/)

I am honored that I was asked and am looking forward to what should be an interesting evening. Hopefully people will not be too distracted by the big hockey game!! The meeting starts tomorrow (April 27th) at 5:30 pm in the Milner (downtown) public library's Centennial Room. 

See ya there.
