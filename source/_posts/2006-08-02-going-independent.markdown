If I have not mentioned it already, after almost 3 years of working for [ThoughtWorks](www.thoughtworks.com) I am leaving to pursue a career as an independent consultant. For readers of this blog who are looking to add an extra dev resource to their team, feel free to contact me if you are interested in engaging me on your current project. I am open for technical lead roles or just pure heads down coding gigs!! I am also not tied to working in just Canada. My wife and I home school our kids, so we are very mobile!!

Feel free to spread the word in the event that you, or someone you know, may be interested in having me join your team for a spell.

I am looking for engagements ranging from a couple of days to upto a year, preferably .Net 2.0 projects utilizing C Sharp.
