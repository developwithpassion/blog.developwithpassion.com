This is a quick note out to all of the people who have registered for the upcoming courses in Germany and Las Vegas.

I apologize for the lack of communication due to my holiday mode status!! I am going to make sure you all get prep material sent out to you by this coming Sunday.

The venues for both the Germany course and the Vegas course are being finalized and will be disclosed by Tuesday of next week.

The reason for posting this on the blog is due to the fact that the mailing lists for the courses have not yet been created, so this is a very public way to apologize for my lack of communication!!

God Bless You and I look forward to starting the correspondence stream!!
