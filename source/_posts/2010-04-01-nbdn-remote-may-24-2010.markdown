The first official [Nothin But .Net](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo) remote course will be taking place at the end of May. Having had a very [successful pilot](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/NothinButNetRemotePilotReviews.aspx). I am confident that people who are unable to make it to a public in-person course; will find the format of the remote course a great opportunity to take part in a great week of training right from their own house!!   
Based on feedback from attendees of the pilot course, here are some recommended items that you will want to have to capitalize on the remote course:   
-Dual Monitor Setup   
-VOIP HeadSet    
-DSL/Cable Internet Connection   
As with all public courses, the attendee limit for the course is capped at 16.
