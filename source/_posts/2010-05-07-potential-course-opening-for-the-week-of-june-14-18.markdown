A sudden change is scheduling has opened up another week where I can host a [Nothin But .Net](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo) course. This post is meant as a way to try to quickly notify people so that requests can be submitted for potential locations.  
If you, or anyone you know, has expressed interest in attending one of the courses; please do not hesitate to contact me at [jp@developwithpassion.com](mailto:jp@developwithpassion.com) and specify the location that you suggest.  
At the end of next week I will post an announcement on the locations that have been suggested.  
[Develop With Passion](http://www.developwithpassion.com)!!
