This post, along with many others to come is serving as a pointer to people that I have worked/will work with about lots of useful unix utilities. Where there are existing good reference I will just post a link, otherwise I'll write my own post. Current time demands warrant that I'm going to be link posting a lot!!

The tools are not mentioned in any particular order, so don't place any significance on which order I choose to mention them.

I am of the opinion that every developer owes it to themselves to get a grounding in unix and its accompanying toolchain, though that's a discussion for a whole other blog post!

Following posts will be absent of the prior blurb and just get right to the tool.

##[nohup](http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/nohup-execute-commands-after-you-exit-from-a-shell-prompt.html)

Used to keep background jobs running when you exit from a shell session.
