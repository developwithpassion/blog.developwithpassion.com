There are just a little over 2 weeks left to [register](http://jpboodhoo.turnstilesystems.com/ProgramDetail.aspx/NothinButNetTorontoOntario) for the Toronto session of Nothin But .Net. If you have not heard what past attendees have had to say, take a look at a small sample of some of the comments from the the last course in Austin,TX:  <ul>   <li>I absolutely loved everything about this course. It will undoubtedly be one of the most memorable experiences of my life... well worth the money. </li> </ul>  
  <ul>   <li>As advertised, this course was a very intense experience that stretched my programming knowledge and gave me may new techniques to apply to my current development. In addition, it offered a new approach, Behavioral Driven Design, to software development that I believe has the potential to increase productivity dramatically.      
Not to take anything away from J.P. as a developer, he is teaching techniques that I believe any programmer can learn to make programming easier. By raising the level of abstraction, he focuses your effort on small parts of the code so that coding seems almost effortless. Also, by letting the specifications drive the development process; his coding style encourages tight implementations without excess baggage.       
I think that the practice of object-oriented programming with some basic design patterns would move <strike>the Microsoft</strike> any development community a long way towards creating maintainable software that would change overall quality to the point that broken software would no longer be considered normal </li> </ul>  
  <ul>   <li>I can't say enough about the quality of this class. I have never attended a class, whether it was a week long training course, seminar, self study, or a college level class that was more valuable to me as a programmer. This class has been a very good investment into my career that will pay for itself many times over. The cost of this class was a steal! JP is a first class professional and his class mirrored that professionalism. It was obvious that he wasn't trying to cut corners and milk out the most profit. This class was not just about knowledge transfer, but about being passionate about programming and taking your skills to the next level and how to actually do it. </li> </ul>  
  <ul>   <li>This is one of the best trainings available. I think everyone should take this course as this provides very useful pointers towards becoming a better developer. I think this course has made me more focused than before on my dream towards becoming a better developer. </li> </ul>  
If you want to break out of a rut for a week, come and spend it with other professionals who are seeking for ways to improve themselves both professionally and personally!!
