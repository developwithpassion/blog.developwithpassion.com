It's has officially begun!!   
The first public (in person) [Nothin But .Net course](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo) of 2010 is scheduled for April 26-30. The course is going to be held at the amazing West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.   
Just like last year, the course will be able to accommodate a maximum of 16 people. Last year there was a course held at the same location and it was an absolute blast.   
If you have been on the fence about taking the course, I hope this is the year that you decide to step up to the plate!!   
If you do happen to sign up, get yourself ready for a week of coding madness. You will most likely leave the week feeling both physically and mentally exhausted. The net result in the aftermath, can be a new outlook on the way you approach your job, skill set, and life in general.   
You can register for the course here: [http://nbdnedmonton2010.eventbrite.com/](http://nbdnedmonton2010.eventbrite.com/)  
Are you ready to Develop With Passion in 2010!!
