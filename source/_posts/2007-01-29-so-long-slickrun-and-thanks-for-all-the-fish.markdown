My good friend [Terry Thibodeau](http://www.connicus.com) just posted about a new version of [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/index.html) that allows me to finally remove [SlickRun](http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun/) from my machine so I don't need to run them both. I won't go into the details, check out [his post](http://www.connicus.com/archive/2007/01/28/new-launchy-version-add-missing-shortcut-keys.aspx). 
As an aside, keep an eye on his blog as this guy is a storehouse of tech/dev knowledge, and he has only just started blogging.
