One the 17th of December, our family home was burned to the ground.

For the last almost 2 months our family of 6 has been shuttling between hotels and generally just trying to figure out the steps to move forward.

We have run the gamut of emotions and are moving into a season of change and new possibilities.

For the last week, I was walking through malls and stores and trying to think of things that I could do to express my love for my wife on valentines day. Every thing that I looked at just did not seem to jump out at me for her. So I thought I would do something different this year, I am writing this blog post as a big "permanent" out there proclamation of my love for the most amazing women that I know.

We met each other when we were in grade 9 of high school, one of the first things she ever spoke to me was "Are you saved, do you know Jesus!", as you can imagine those words took me for quite a surprise. Over the years we hung out, and ultimately she was the one who lead me to a knowledge of the personal relationship with Jesus. Bar none, the greatest thing anyone could have ever done for me.

After a couple of failed attempts to move out of the "friend zone" we made the transition on a seemingly ordinary night with a kiss that to this day I can only describe as magical. 

As a friend I was amazing, as a boyfriend I was a bit of a dud. I unfortunately had not developed the strength to stand strong for us in the midst of pressure from good friends and this put a siginificant amount of strain on our relationship in what should have been one of our most fun years of high school.

We got married months after graduation, how mature was I? Well let's put it this way, I used our wedding gift money to buy a nintendo 64 video game system. Yep, I was quite the catch.

My amazing wife worked so that I could go back to school and make something of myself, all the while being there to raise our new son while I became a bit of a ghost during the school years. Of course, after graduating, things would be amazing right? High tech job, good salary. Well, let's just say that my "tunnel vision" with respect to growing skills paid of huge in the work department, but it also meant that my time as a "disconnected husband and father" still had some playing out to
do.

By now you are probably either thinking that my wife has amazing patience, or she is a sucker for punishment. Well, let me just reiterate an amazing verse from the bible:

{% blockquote Proverbs 31:10-31, Bible %}
Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: “Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.” Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.  Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
{% endblockquote %}

Thankfully, this story has an amazingly happy ending. They say that we marry the person that helps us close the gaps in ourself that we can't see. Through amazing Godly love, and lots of patience our marriage is amazing, and vibrant. I dropped the tunnel visioned workaholic habits a long time ago, and for the last almost 6 years I can actually say with 100% confidence that my words and actions as a husband reflect who I envisioned myself to be when I thought about what a godly husband and
father should be.

Honey, you are an amazing godly women. I could not have envisioned in a million years that God would see fit to bless me with such a beautiful and caring person. Your patience is amazing, your love and encouragement is a constant source of strenght for me. Your love and care for our children and the huge number of their friends who enter our home on a daily basis is a constantly humbling and amazing thing to experience. You are stunnigly beatiful, athletic, and just plain amazing fun.
Thank you so much for agreeing to take my hand and walk down this amazing road of life together. Thank you for your enduring patience as you waited for me to become the man that God must have revealed to you that I would become. Thank you for daily teaching and modeling to all of us what it means to love others like Jesus would have, and to accept and welcome anyone who crosses our path.

I know the next year looks like it will be a little bit of a roller coaster. Our house may have burned to the ground, 17 years of pictures, baby books, and memorabilia can't be replaced, but I know that together we are going to carve out an another set of amazing memories as we walk hand in hand together down whatever paths God puts in front of us.

On this valentines day, know that you are loved more than these "permanent" words can express.

I love you yesterday, today, tomorrow, and forever.

Your Always Loving Husband!!!
