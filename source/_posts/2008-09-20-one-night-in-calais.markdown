We finished up our stay in the UK today and left from the wonderful home we had been staying in, in [Broadstairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadstairs) to head onto the European leg of our tour!!

The plan was to drop off our rental vehicle, catch the ferry to Calais and then finally catch the trains that eventually would lead us to Brussels so that I could do the Meet And Greet tonight!!

Well, as great as the plan sounded, we missed the last train to Brussels and so we now have to spend the night in Calais!!

Tomorrow we will head off in the morning and make our way towards Dusseldorf. I apologize to all of the people I will not be able to meet tonight!!

Bonne nuit!!
