Hey Everyone. I have to apologize for the recent downtime that the site has experienced. The service provider contacted me a few minutes ago and let me know that they had resolved the issue. I am out of town for the next 2 days and when I get back I plan to get started building out a comparative solution to the application that I build on DNRTv. Stay tuned. 

Thanks for your patience.
