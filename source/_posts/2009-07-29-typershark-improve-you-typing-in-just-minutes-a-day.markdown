As an excuse to play around with a modified audio/visual setup, I thought I would kill two birds with one stone and do a quick screencast on improving your keyboarding skills over time using the game [TyperShark](http://www.popcap.com/games/free/typershark).   
This screencast gives a brief overview of the game and a sample playthrough of one level.   
The screencast can be found [here](http://www.developwithpassion.com/content/screencasts/2009/july/july_27_typer_shark.mov).  
If you enjoy the video/sound quality let me know as I am planning to do a lot more in the forseeable future.
