Thanks to [Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/08/19/_5B00_Tools_5D00_-Switched-to-Notepad_2B002B002C00_-here_2700_s-my-C_2300_-syntax-file.aspx) I have also deserted Notepad2 in favour of [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm). Like so many other tools in my utility folder, it is lightweight, effective, and free!!

I encourage you to give it a try as I am sure that you will not be disappointed.
