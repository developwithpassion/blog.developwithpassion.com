Last year I had the opportunity to share a class with a person who had lost his wife to cancer a while prior to the course. 

During the course of the week I had been talking to everyone about the importance of using your time effectively, and to make it count for the best of the abilities that you have been blessed with.

At the end of the week he took the time to share his story with some of the class. To some of us he took the time to share a brochure that was a testimony to the life that his wife lived.

The brochure itself was beautiful, and I would not really be able to do it justice by trying to copy the entire thing into this blog post.

On the back of the brochure is a particularly awesome poem that I wanted to take the time to share. It is titled: A New Day.

*A New Day*

>This is the beginning of a new day. God has given me this day to use as I will.

>I can waste it-or use it for good, but what I do today is important, because I am exchanging a day of my life for it!

>When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, leaving in its place, something that I have traded for it.

>I want it to be gain, and not loss; good, and not evil; success, and not failure, in order that I shall not regret the price I have paid for it.


Awesome words, and definitely worth thinking about. Time is the one resource that most of us treat as renewable. It's not. We have to make every single minute count.
