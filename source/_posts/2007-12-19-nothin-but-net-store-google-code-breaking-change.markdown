I just upgraded the [project](http://code.google.com/p/jpboodhoo) to a VS2008 project and am now starting to demonstrate (and will continue to do so in the new year) how to integrate some of the new language features.

This means that if you don't have .Net 3.5 installed on your machine you will not longer be able to run the NAnt build. Furthermore, if you do not have VS2008 on your machine you will not be able to open the solution.

Sorry!!

 

Develop with Passion!!
