A couple of people have asked about where the source code I placed on google code had moved. It has all been moved over to assembla. Here are the projects that are currently up there:  
bdddoc - [http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/bdddoc](http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/bdddoc) – Tool for generating html documents based on your unit tests. Works with any attribute driven testing framework.  
   
jpboodhoo.bdd - [http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/jpboodhoo_bdd](http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/jpboodhoo_bdd) – Library that contains my current approach to writing tests. Is basically a thin wrapper on top of MBUnit 2 that has a much more natural feel to it. If you want some examples of how to write tests with this, please send email requests for a blog post!!  
   
nbdn_web_store - [http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/nbdn_web_store](http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/nbdn_web_store) – Web store project that was harvested from the 2008 Germany Nothin But .Net course. Demonstrates the use of front controller architecture, fluent interfaces, bdd, interface based programming etc…  
Develop With Passion!!
