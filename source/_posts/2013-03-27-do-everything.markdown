Fell in love with this song quite a while ago. Thought I would share it here, to hopefully give you a boost for the day!! You might not love the video style (I think it's pretty creative), but really listen to the words and let it remind you that everything we do matters.

"Do everything you do to the glory of the one who made you!!"
