For those of you who were hoping to catch up with me at next weeks [Tulsa Tech Fest](http://www.tulsatechfest.com/), I regret to announce that I will no longer be able to attend the conference. I contacted David Walker earlier in the day to let him know that I was not going to be able to make it.  
I am hoping that there will be another opportunity in the future to come down to the states and deliver a presentation on any one of the topics that I feel extremely passionate about.
