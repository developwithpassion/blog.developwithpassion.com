As most of you can probably tell, to the suffering of this blog, I am spending more time lately doing the presentation / mentoring thing!! For me it is a lot more fun (than blogging) as it allows me to cover topics at a greater level of detail, plus it has the bonus of allowing me to meet some really great developers. And because my wife and I home school our kids, we all travel together which gives us great opportunities to see new places. 
What's next in the presentation pipeline: <ul> <li>Victoria Code Camp - January 27th (this coming Saturday) - Along with a host of great speakers who are lined up, I will be giving 2 presentations</li> <ul> <li>Applied Patterns Of Enterprise Applicaton Architecture - 11:00AM - 12:00PM</li> <li>Generic - Theyr'e not just for collections - 1:00PM - 2:00PM</li></ul></ul> 
If you happen to be in Victoria this weekend try and make it out to the code camp. With the speakers who are presenting, and the material that will be covered it will be a great investment of time.
