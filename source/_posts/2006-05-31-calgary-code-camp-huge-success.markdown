This is a little late (better late than never). This past Saturday marked the hosting of Calgary's first ever .Net Code Camp. The turnout was amazing (especially for a Saturday), and lots of fun was had by all. I delivered a presentation titled : TDD, Dependency Injection and the Data Access Layer. I am going to be posting my code along with a video for all my remote readers who were unable to attend. The next code camp on the horizon is the [Edmonton code camp](http://www.edmontoncodecamp.com/). I have a couple of ideas in my head on presentation material, but it is a long way off so I've got lots of time to formulate/receive ideas. Thanks to everyone who provided feedback (positive and negative) on the presentation, it is always appreciated.
