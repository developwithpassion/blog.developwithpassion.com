Just in the process of repaving a new desktop [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) image. Installed rvm and got the following error when trying to update the gems package:

{% codeblock bash %}
$ sudo gem update --system 
... in `require': no such file to load -- zlib (LoadError)
{% endcodeblock %}

Simple fix:

{% codeblock bash %}
sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev 
{% endcodeblock %}

After that it's smooth sailing.
