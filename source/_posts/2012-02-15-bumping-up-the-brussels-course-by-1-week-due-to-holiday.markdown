Well, it looks like the Brussels course was scheduled on a week of a national holiday!

To that end we are now bumping the course up by one week to the week of April 23rd.

Remember, if you register before the end of February and use the discount code : earlybirdforbrusselsis10 , you will receive a 10% discount off the cost of the course.

Hope to see you there!!
