The [company](http://www.jetbrains.com) that continues to build butt kicking tools for .Net developers has just released version 2 of their [insane profiler](http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/) for .Net applications. [DotTrace](http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/) is my personal unreserved choice for profiling in .Net. With the introduction of version 2 they have added a host of new features the most notable being the addition of memory profiling. 
If you are an existing license holder, then the price for upgrading is a big "0.00". That's right, version 2 is free if you already have a license for version 1. Do these guys know how to license or what? 
If you haven't taken the time to give DotTrace a whirl, I encourage you to go and [download](http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/download/index.html) the latest trial and take it for a spin. 
While you are there pick up version 1 of [UnitRun](http://www.jetbrains.com/unitrun/) (if you already have ReSharper, you already have UnitRun).
