[Dave Laribee](http://laribee.com/blog/) and I will be giving a talk titled - [You Got Served : Ping Pong Pairing](http://www.okcodecamp.com/Sessions/AgileTrack/YouGotServedPingPongPairing/tabid/75/Default.aspx), at the [Oklahoma code camp](http://www.okcodecamp.com/) on July 28<sup>th</sup>. I am pretty pumped about this session, and you can expect that Dave and I will be bustin out some ReSharper madness and Domain Driven Design goodness right before your very eyes!!

There are lots of good speakers who are going to be speaking at the code camp, so the event promises to be very interesting. If you happen to be in the area, come check out what promises to be a great day of coding.
