I'm sure lots of us have questioned the purpose for God allowing us to experience the deep valleys in our life. The knowledge that the purpose of the valley is sometimes necessary for the development/refinement/elimination of character or heart attributes, often does not make the walk through the valley any easier.

It's also funny that often, when we are in the valley, we can reach out for God and sometimes get the "feeling" that He has abandoned us. I think, also, this period is for strengthening our resolve of "knowing" that He is there even when our emotions are trying to tell us otherwise. These periods can help transition our faith to something more than just fleeting/extended periods of emotional euphoria to something much deeper and rooted in something a lot more solid than our flimsy human
emotions!

I was reading the Screwtape Letters earlier today and came across this fantastic excerpt that I wanted to share. As you read this keep in mind the fact that this is being written from the perspective of the demons!

{% blockquote CS Lewis, The Screwtape Letters %}
Do not be deceived, Wormwood, Our cause is never more in danger that when a human, no longer desiring, but still indending, to do our Enemy's will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.
