At our church this year, the theme for the duration of the year is The Year Of Purpose!!   
The realization and fulfillment of purpose is something that is very near and dear to my heart. When I was in my late teens, my thoughts were not directed towards what I should or could be doing with my life. Getting thrust into the role of a husband and father at a young age was one of the catalysts that put me on the path to focusing on what I should be doing with my life. And more importantly, how I could use my life and vocation to be able to share Jesus with others.   
We can all have periods where we feel like we lose our way a little. We can wake up and ask ourselves "Why am I here, what am I doing"? For as much as I love software development, I am far more blessed by being able to take part in the opportunity to help someone get a clearer vision of the "Why and what".   
Since it is the year of purpose, I am going to offer a copy of the amazing book ["The Purpose Driven Life"](http://www.amazon.com/Purpose-Driven-Life-Rick-Warren/dp/0310205719) to the first 5 people who email me at jp@developwithpassion.com.   
Develop With Passion!!
