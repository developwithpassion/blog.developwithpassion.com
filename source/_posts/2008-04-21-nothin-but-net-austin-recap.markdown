What can I say. I could not have asked for a more fabulous group of people to have as a class. The week was full of coding madness, resharper jedi magic, VimFu, and most importantly - amazing conversation between a group of people who are passionate about self improvement!!  
It was awesome to have the help of [Mo](http://mokhan.ca/) as a great as my TA for the week. He saved me countless numbers of hours by taking care of a bunch of administrative tasks as well as ensuring that the flow was not interrupted whenever machine issues would come up.  
Finally, it was excellent to have Scott Bellware come in and give a session on Behavior Driven Development. All of the students were introduced to behavior driven development over the course of the week, as that was how I was teaching them to write their tests. It was excellent to have Scott come in to reiterate and reinforce some of the ideas and implementation behind BDD.  
Austin is a beautiful city, and I look forward to hosting another course there sometime in the future!!  
Develop With Passion.
