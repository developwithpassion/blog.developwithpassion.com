I have the amazing honor of being able to speak at [DevTeach 2007](http://www.devteach.com/) in Montreal this spring.  I'll be giving talks on: <ol> <li>Refactoring - A Primer <li>Applied Patterns Of Enterprise Application Architecture</li></ol> 
The lineup looks amazing, and I am truly honored to be a part of it all.
