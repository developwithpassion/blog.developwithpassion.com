Hey everyone. I know a lot of people have been waiting patiently for this series, and I don't want to disappoint. I was sitting down to write entry number 2 and I realized that a lot of the feel and flow can get lost when I write a test, write some code etc, and then write up what I did. I really want to give people a feel for how the process actually works. To this end, I am going to be doing the rest of the series as a set of videos (with accompanying code) that people can follow along and watch. This will give people a much better idea of how TDD actually works, and over the course of the next couple of months, you will get to see the construction of a fairly non-trivial application. 

I have to once again apologize for the delay, as I have been extremely busy as of late. I will not be doing any posting whatsoever during the first 3 weeks of July, as my family and I will be heading out for a big vacation!!

I hope to get the first video out by the end of Monday.

Thanks
