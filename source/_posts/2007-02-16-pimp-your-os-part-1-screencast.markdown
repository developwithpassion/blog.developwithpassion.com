In an earlier post, I had mentioned that a friend of mine ([Terry Thibodeau](http://www.connicus.com)) would be creating a series that detailed streamlining your OS installation process. I just finished watching [part 1](http://www.connicus.com/archive/2007/02/15/pimp-your-os-part-1.aspx) of his series and the information is awesome. 
If you are interested at all in saving time for yourself when you need to install an OS from scratch, you need to watch this series. 
Check out Part 1 [here](http://www.connicus.com/archive/2007/02/15/pimp-your-os-part-1.aspx).
