When it comes to books on programming, some of my favourite are ones that leave you with practical advice and guidance that is drawn directly from the trenches of applying and refining the concepts. The [pragmatic bookshelf][pragbook] is indicative of this style of writing, and I often do not hesitate to recommend lots of their books to people that I work with.

The bookshelf now has claim to another great book that is written by someone that I once had the honour of working with. [The Agile Samurai](agilesam) is a great book that comes straight from the trenches of working, refinining, and applying agile practices. Jonathan Rasmusson ("JR"), is a master programmer, iteration manager, and general jack of all software trades. I would be able to recommend the book alone just based on the content that is within the pages, but I can recommend it
even stronger knowing that JR has condensed into its pages the dissemination of practices, war wounds, and nuggets that could only have been gleaned by someone who has proven each of the techniques on projects of all sizes.

I gave the following recommendation in the opening sections of the book:

> This book was written with the insight and clarity that can only come
> from a person who has proved these techniques in the trenches. I
> have read many books on agile software development; this is by far
> the most engaging, easy to read, and just plain fun of them all. Get
> ready to sharpen that sword!

For fun, you may also want to check out the awesome [Bruce Lee promotional video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d_37JLoOmg), that JR put together for the book (it is hilarious).

Enjoy sharpening the sword!!
