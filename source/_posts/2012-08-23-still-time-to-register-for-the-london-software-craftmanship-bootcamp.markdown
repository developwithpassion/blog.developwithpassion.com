Time is fast approaching for the next iteration of the Develop With Passion® Software Craftmanship BootCamp to be held in London,UK (September 10-14th).

Once again, this year we will be hosting the course at the Ramada Hyde Park. Registration details can be found [here](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1570733105/eorg).

You can come expecting 5 fun filled days of coding madness. Come and learn fundamental software principles, patterns, and techniques that will help take you to the next level in your career as a computer programmer. The course will be using .Net as a delivery mechanism, but past students will iterate that the course really has nothing to do with .Net. It is a walkthrough of practical application design techiques and approaches that you can use regardless of what your primary
development environment/platform is.

If you are up for a challenge, or you feel like your dev routine needs a bit of a kick in the pants, sign up for what many others have called a "game-changer" in both their life and career.

I look forward to seeing you [there](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1570733105/eorg)!
