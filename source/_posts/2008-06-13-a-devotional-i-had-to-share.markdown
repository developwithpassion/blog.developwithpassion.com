Every morning for the last week I have been subscribed to the [Daily Success](http://iblp.org/iblp/discipleship/dailysuccess/overview/whatismeditation/) devotional program. When I check my email in the morning one of the messages that I read is a devotional that gives me some words of scripture that I can try to memorize and start applying to my daily life. The topic that was discussed this morning has been one that seems to be popping up a lot in close circles for me right now. So I thought I would take the time to share the story with everyone:
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica"><em>"One day the president of a successful real estate company stood before his sales staff of about one hundred. After presenting several new properties, he stated, “My success story has been written up in a national business magazine. If you would like a copy, just see my secretary.”</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"><em>
</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica"><em>A lightning bolt of dismay and tension struck the staff. Angry looks were exchanged, and murmuring began: “Who does he think he is?! We are the ones that made this company successful! It is our success story, not his.”</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"><em>
</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica"><em>That very afternoon, several of his top salesmen quit and formed their own company. Soon there was not enough money to close contracts, so the president used money from other escrow accounts, which is a federal offense. Within six months, the once-successful company was dissolved, and the president began serving a prison sentence, all because of the lack of one character quality—humility.</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"><em>
</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica"><em>“By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life” (Proverbs 22:4).</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"><em>
</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica"><em>Pride is the sin that God hates the most and punishes the swiftest. Pride caused Satan and a third of the angels to be cast out of heaven. Pride was the cause of Adam and Eve’s dismissal from the Garden of Eden. It is also the cause of our unrepentance over sin, which keeps God from blessing us with riches, honor, and life. “Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way … do I hate” (Proverbs 8:13). God resists the proud and so do people. That is why conflicts are stirred up, because “only by pride cometh contention” (Proverbs 13:10).</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"><em>
</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica"><em>Pride is putting ourselves on an equal level with God. It is reserving for ourselves the right to decide what is right or wrong. Our pride is what put Jesus on the cross. We are just like those who said, “We will not have this man reign over us.”</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"><em>
</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica"><em>Pride is projecting on the outside what is not true on the inside. Today, let’s conquer this primary hindrance to daily success by humbling ourselves before a holy God and making things right with all those whom we have offended."</em>
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica"><em>
