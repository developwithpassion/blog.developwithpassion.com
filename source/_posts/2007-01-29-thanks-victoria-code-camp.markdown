This past weekend (January 27th) I presented at the Victoria Code Camp. It was a blast. The people were awesome and the questions were great.  
My family and I flew up and arrived Thursday morning. We did the tourist thing for Thursday,Friday, and Sunday. 
The turnout was impressive (close to 100 if I remember correctly). With 3 tracks going on there was lots of good information to be snapped up by attendees. It was great to also hang out with fellow friends and bloggers [James Kovacs](http://www.jameskovacs.com), [Justice Gray](http://graysmatter.codivation.com/), and the [Igloo Coder](http://www.igloocoder.com). 
Great thanks to [Nolan Zak](http://blog.nolanzak.com/) and the rest of the code camp organizers for giving myself and others the opportunity to present!! 
Also, for our first time in Victoria, we were blessed with great weather (according to locals). 
I look forward to having an opportunity to go back and do some other work with the folks in Victoria!!
