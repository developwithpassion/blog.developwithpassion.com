Well, I finally joined the blogosphere! Consider this blog as an outlet for me to share my thoughts, opinions, and suggestions about some of the following topics : 

* Enterprise Development With .Net 
* Test Driven Development * Domain Driven Design 
* The Trials and Tribulations of Working With Visual Studio 

I have to speak quickly to the last point. Over the course of my development career I have, for the most part, spent most of my time in the Microsoft world. And yet I am considered, by many, to have viewpoints that are very contrary to the typical Microsoft viewpoints on application development. I have made it one of my personal missions to share information that is definitely not common place in the MS world right now. Information that I feel can help developers reach a new level of enjoyment and satisfaction while coding using Microsoft technologies, in particular with the .Net Framework. So who am I that I feel I can speak about these things? I am a Senior Developer with ThoughtWorks where I am involved daily with the development of complex enterprise scale applications. I have presented several MSDN webchats on the topics of application development with the .Net Framework, and have been actively working with .Net since beta 1 of 1.0. Stay tuned, lots of great information to follow.
