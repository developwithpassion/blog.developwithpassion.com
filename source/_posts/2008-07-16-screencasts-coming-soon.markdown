This is a quick post to announce that [developwithpassion.com](http://www.developwithpassion.com) will soon be launching a screencasts tab, where people will be able to download/watch videos of coding sessions that myself and people that I collaborate with are working on. It is going to be a fairly informal place to host material that is much better shared in screencast format.



One of the things that you can expect to see on this tab are screencasts of all of the presentations I will do from this point forward. Even though I said I would be doing my last [public presentation in Orlando,](http://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=NmpnN2dpc3B1Mm5hZzZtYTQzODdzYzdpcDAgb21kYXRuaDB1YmNyaWlrdmdwMWhkcjJxZDBAZw&ctz=America/New_York) one of things that I clarified in a comment was that if invited to speak at a user group, I would definitely consider it. I am just not going to seek out presentation spots anymore, to maintain inline with my current working set of goals.



The presentation that I am doing on Thursday at the Orlando .Net User Group, will be screencasted and made available on [my site](http://www.developwithpassion.com) for people to download and watch at their leisure.



The screencasts tab should launch by the end of next week at the latest!!



Develop With Passion!!
