Just thought I would share an amazing devotion that I read this morning, written by Max Lucado. Helps to remind us of one of the things that really matters:

{% blockquote Max Lucado %}
Name the ten wealthiest men in the world. Name eight people who have won the Nobel or Pulizer Prize. How did you do? I didn't do well either. With the exception of the trivia hounds, none of us remember the headliners of yesterday too well. Surprising how quickly we forget, isn't it? And... these are the best in their fields. But the applause dies. Awards tarnish. Acheivements are forgotten.

Here's another quiz...Name ten people who have taught you something worthwhile. Name five friends who have helped you in a difficult time. Easier? It was for me, too. The lesson? The people who make a difference are not the ones with the credentials, but the ones with the concern.
