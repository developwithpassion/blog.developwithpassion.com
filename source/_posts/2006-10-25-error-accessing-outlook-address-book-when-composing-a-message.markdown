Since I have decided to start using my blog as a personal scratch pad.  I thought I would log this in case I needed it for future reference. I was composing a new email in Outlook 2003 and I got the following error message when I tried to add a contact from my address book:

<strong><font color="#ff0000"> The address list could not be displayed. The Contacts folder associated with this address list could not be opened; it may have been moved or deleted, or you do not have permissions. For information on how to remove this folder from the Outlook Address Book, see Microsoft Outlook Help.</font></strong>

Of course Google to the rescue!! I found the document that helped me figure out the solution here: [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/319901](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/319901).

Hope this helps!!
