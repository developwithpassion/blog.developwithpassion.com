Ever since the nightly builds for ReSharper 4.0 went live, being the REA (Resharper early adopter) that I am, I downloaded it and have been using it on my C# 3.5 projects. I am happy to report that even though it is in the pre EAP phase, it is extremely solid and a joy to work with.  
The support for the new language features such as extension methods, automatic properties ... is great. So far I have had only one exception dialog pop up. For those of you who have braved prior EAP's for ReSharper (remember ReSharper 2.0 EAP!!!) you have probably already developed a thick skin for the exception dialogs that typically pop up during EAP. So far this is not the case.  
In all honesty, those of us who love ReSharper would be more than willing to put up with multiple exception dialogs as, let's face it, studio without ReSharper == "I won't use it".  
So what are you waiting for, head over and [download](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+Nightly+Builds) the latest nightly build. Keep in mind that results may vary between use as well as different nightly builds!!  
Develop with Passion!!
