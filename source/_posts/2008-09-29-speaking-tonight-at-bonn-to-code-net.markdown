Sorry for the late notice on this one!! I have been blessed with the honor of presenting at the [Bonn-to-Code.Net](http://www.bonn-to-code.net/1629.aspx) user group in Bonn tonight!!

I am going to be doing a fairly relaxed session describing behaviour driven development.

The presentation starts at 7:00PM. If you happen to be in the area please stop by. I am sure a great time will be had by all!!

Develop With Passion.
