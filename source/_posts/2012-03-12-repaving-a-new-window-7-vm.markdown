On Thurday my windows vm image died along with my backup of it!!

I thought this was a good opportunity to repave a brand new vm that I can also create linked clones from to quickly scaffold new vm's moving forward.

This post is mostly to help me remember the install process and the base tools that I install on a fresh windows 7 vm, as this is not something I do very often!! I included screenshots of most of the install steps, just so I can both remind myself what my defaults are, as well as for your benefit if you wish to copy this setup.

##Base Tools Install

1. [Vista Switcher](http://www.ntwind.com/software/vistaswitcher/download.html)

    Install the following packages:

    * Archive
      * unzip - Unzipping zip files
    * Net
      * openssl - bin and sources
      * openssh - Only if you are not going to compile openssh yourself
      * curl - download internet resources
    * Devl
      * colorgcc
      * gcc
      * gcc-core - compiler
      * git
      * git-completion
      * git-gui
      * git-svn
      * gitk
      * libtool - Shared library generation tool. You'll need it when trying to compile rubies
      * libncurses-devel - Used when compiling several other tools I use
      * make
      * mercurial
      * openssl-devel - Required for compiling openssh (not necessarily required for rvm, but I always install it to compile openssh myself)
      * readline
    * Utils
      * ncurses - Enabling better handling of terminal
      * patch - Apply a diff file to an original. Again, you'll need it when rvm is trying to patch the ruby installs

Along with the tools outlined above I also manually compiled the following:

* [dvtm](http://github.com/developwithpassion/dvtm)
* [vim](http://www.vim.org)
* [screen](git://git.savannah.gnu.org/screen.git)
* [zsh](git://zsh.git.sf.net/gitroot/zsh/zsh)


Well that's it for the base tool install!! There are a couple of other steps I do to configure msys and cygwin to play nice together, but that's another post!! Outside of that, this is what constitutes my bare minimum for a usable windows vm. From this base image, I can create [linked clones](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/2012/04/17/screencast-creating-linked-clones-with-vmware-fusion/) that allow me to create project specific vm's that have further tools installed (such as vs, vs.net etc) specific to the contract/project I am working on.

##Still To Come
In a follow up post I'll detail a set of tools, scripts and code that allows me to configure this entire toolset, so that I can have a seamless environment that supports :

* Vim with a host of my favourite plugins
* An organized eaash environment with well partitioned dotfiles etc
* Simple, plugin style automation tasks

Most importantly, the bash/vim/automation setup I have allows me to share all of the important scripts such as:

* dotfiles
* automation scripts

On all three of the main environments I work in :

* OSX
* Ubuntu
* Windows (cygwin and mingw)

Until next time!!
