Well, another amazing year has passed and my family and I look toward the upcoming 2013 year with hope and promise.

Highlights of the year:

* My wife and I celebrated our 16th anniversary!!
* We got the opportunity to travel the world once again with our kids.
* My wife got to experience the joy of getting fitted for a Wedding dress, something we missed doing when we got married.
* Blessed with a great six month contract that enabled us to spend 6 months at home.
* Planted over 1000 trees on our property, and worked hard to install a drip irrigation system.
* Wrote a video game with my kids (hobby project).
* Climbed a waterfall
* Experienced car-free day in Brussels!
* Got to see Jerry Seinfeld perform at the Colleseum (hilarious)
* Helped a brand new developer get their start in the world of programming.
* Our family got hooked on rock climbing.
* Got one step closer toward our retirement goals!!
* Got robbed in downtown Vancouver!!
* Incubated and hatched our own chickens.
* Started raising our own chickens (more than 50 in total).
* ( Related to the prior point ) Completed our own chicken slaughter (about 17, so we do not need to purchase our own organic chicken) .
* Spent Christmas in Las Vegas with a lot of our extended family!

Whenever we look back on our year in highlights, I am constantly amazed at how there is little on there to reflect coding prowess, software acheivements etc. Anyone who knows me is aware that I love what I do for a profession, but they also know that it is just what I do, not who I am. I feel blessed to be able to be able to have a job that allows me to sharpen my sword on a daily basis, travel with my family, spend lots of time with my wife and kids. And most importantly, to 
put Jesus at the center of everything we do and to live a life of purpose on purpose. 

We look forward to seeing what the Lord has in store for our family in the 2013 year!

I pray that 2012 was an amazing year of growth for you, and your family; and know that I am sincere in my prayer for you to have an amazing 2013!!
