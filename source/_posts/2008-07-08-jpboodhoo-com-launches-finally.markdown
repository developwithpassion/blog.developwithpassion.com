For months now I have been telling people that I was going to be launching a full blown web site. With the amount of work I had taken on, it kept getting placed on the backburner. I finally decided to delegate the task to someone else. With a little help (and by little I mean he did absolutely everything!!) from [Mo](http://mokhan.ca/), the site was built in a week. I just deployed it last night!!  
Go to: [http://www.developwithpassion.com](http://www.developwithpassion.com) to view the site. Click around and you will be able to find out more about the things I am currently doing, information on the [Nothin But. Net developer bootcamp](http://developwithpassion.com/training.oo) and all sorts of other interesting tidbits. There are a couple of pages that are not currently active as the target web server does not have a SQL Server database installed yet. These pages are mostly dealing with viewing the feedback from previous courses as well as photo albums of the prior courses.  
Couple of interesting points about the site:  <ul>   <li>Built with:      <ul>       <li>ASP .Net MVC </li>        <li>Castle Windsor </li>        <li>NHibernate </li>        <li>Log4Net </li>        <li>SQL Server </li>        <li>CSS </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Source for the site will be released within the next couple of months (to be used as a learning tool for other developers) </li>    <li>Site Design By [Stuart Knox](http://designgoblin.com/) (an incredible web designer) </li> </ul>  
Stay tuned as over the next couple of months there will be exciting new content that will be released!!  
Please let me know if there are things that you would like to see on the site going forward.  
Develop With Passion!!
