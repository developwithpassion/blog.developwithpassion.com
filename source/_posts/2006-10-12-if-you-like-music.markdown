This is something I should have blogged about a long time ago (although seeing how I keep my personal life very private, it should be no surprise). My amazingly talented sister has been hard at work recording songs for an album she is working on. Head over to her [myspace](http://www.myspace.com/marikaspace) page if you are interested in hearing some of her stuff. As well as being an incredible singer, she is also an extremely loving mother and wife!! I am very proud of her. 
Request her songs on your local radio stations, and let's spread the word about her awesome music.
