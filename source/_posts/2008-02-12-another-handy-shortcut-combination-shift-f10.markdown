I might be a little late on this one, but I just learned a new shortcut that will definitely save me time when I am working in my VM on my mac. I love to use the keyboard. And when I use my natural keyboard it is fairly easy to access context menus (right click) by using the context menu key on the keyboard. My MacBook does not have such a key. This meant that up until yesterday (when I learned the shortcut) I had to have a mouse plugged in any time I wanted to access the context menu.

Shift-F10 is actually a keyboard shortcut that accomplishes the exact same thing as the context menu key / right click.

Thanks to [Jay Smith](http://jaysmith.us/) for pointing this out for me.
