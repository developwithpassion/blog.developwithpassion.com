Should have mentioned this a while ago. An [article I wrote on Model View Presenter](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/08/DesignPatterns/default.aspx) has been published in MSDN magazine. It will also be available in print in the August edition.

If you have time to read the article, feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
