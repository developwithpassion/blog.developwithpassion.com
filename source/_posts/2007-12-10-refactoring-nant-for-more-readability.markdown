[Adam](http://blog.streamlinelogic.ca/) just recently [posted](http://blog.streamlinelogic.ca/2007/12/cryptic-nant-scripts.html) about refactoring NAnt build files to introduce a much clearer understanding of NAnt and associated build files for people who may not be familiar with typical NAnt style naming conventions. I am definitely a culprit of the style of naming that he dislikes (when it comes to my NAnt files!!), and will definitely take his recommendation to heart when introducing NAnt in the future!!
