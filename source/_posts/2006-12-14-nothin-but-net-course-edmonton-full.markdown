It didn't take long!! Because the online payment option is still not functional (merchant account setup is taking longer than I thought) all registrants are working on the honor system!! 
As soon as I am able to accept payment I will be sending emails to all the registrants so that they can make payment. 
At that time, if there are people who change their mind, their spots will be freed up for other interested parties. 
If there are still people who are interested in the Edmonton course please feel free to contact me, as it will help me gauge the interest level for a follow up course in Edmonton in the future.
