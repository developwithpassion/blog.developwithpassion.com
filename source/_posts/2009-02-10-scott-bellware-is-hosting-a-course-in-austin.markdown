Scott is going to be hosting a course in Austin on TDD,BDD, and a whole host of other topics that will make people more productive. It is a one day course and you can check out more information here:

Much of what I have learned about BDD was ignited by Scott. Before I started pair programming with him I was very much a traditional styled TDD developer. If you have an opportunity to spend a day of learning with him I strongly recommend you jump all over it!!  
Develop With Passion!!
