##Overview

Tools For Getting Things Done is a <strong>Free!!</strong> one hour introduction to a small subset of tools that Develop With Passion速 uses to "get things done".

In a busy digital world, your attention can often be pulled in several different directions. It can often be helpful as "technologists" to leverage tools that enable you to focus on the things you need to get done as much as possible, which ultimately can free your time for more important things over the long run.

This session will introduce you to some tools and give you some ideas of possible worflows for how these tools can be used in the context of day to day activities, all resulting in a net effect of freeing your mind to focus on more important things.

##Core Concepts Overview

* Strategies for handling your physical mail - aka "How to deal with your real spam"!!

* Managing your "ink" repositories - aka "Where was that notebook that I wrote that in again"

* Managing your browsing lifecycle - aka "What was that page I was looking at again"

* Notes everywhere - all the time.

##Requirements 

* Computer with access to an internet connection
