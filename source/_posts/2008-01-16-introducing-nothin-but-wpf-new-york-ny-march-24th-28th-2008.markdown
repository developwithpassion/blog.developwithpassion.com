As promised, 2008 is the year that new courses get brought into the mix. I am happy to announce that [Wendy Friedlander](http://wundasworld.blogspot.com/)<font color="#0000ff"> </font>has jumped on as a trainer with the Nothin But * line of courses and is going to be offering a new course strictly targeting developers wanting to learn how to pragmatically utilize WPF.

You can register for the course [here](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaID=150216).

Here is an overview:
<hr>
Nothin But WPF is a five day boot camp style course that will focus on applying WPF development best practices in the context of developing a working application. Registrants will learn about how to practically apply WPF as they apply it to the task of building a complete application with focus on a WPF user interface and design patterns. 

WARNING!!!!

If you are expecting to come to this course to learn about how to have VS.Net automatically generate an 'application' for you, then this course is NOT for you.

If you are expecting to come to this course to learn how to make cool widgets or animations, then this course is NOT for you.

This course is all about leveraging and understanding of the .Net WPF framework and having it work the way you want. This course will place a heavy emphasis on creating user interfaces that provide an enriching experience in a predictable, creative and testable way.

There will be no use of any designers and all UI will be hand written xaml. I will teach development techniques and wpf patterns that will dramatically increase your day to day productivity as a software developer.

This course will focus on a code centric view of application development instead of the designer magic covered by many typical .Net courses. You will walk away with a deep understanding of fundamental aspects of WPF and how these pieces can be used to develop and deliver enriching, fun applications.

Core Concepts Overview

*        Expand the capabilities of developing with VS.Net - Enter ReSharper (a productivity add-in for Visual Studio .Net)

*        There's more to WPF than elaborate interfaces
*        XAML UI Elements      
*        ItemsContainers
*        Custom Controls
*        Styles and Resources
*        DataBinding
*        Commands
*        Deployment
