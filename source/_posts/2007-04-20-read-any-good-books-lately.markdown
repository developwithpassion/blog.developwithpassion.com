Having seen what [Justice](http://graysmatter.codivation.com/HowIAmBecomingABetterDeveloperPart1OfInfinity.aspx) is upto, I thought I would take the time to answer a question that I get asked all the time 'What's books do you recommend I should read'?

While the scope of the books I could recommend is quite large, I am going to narrow my focus to the realm of the developer. Some of these books are ones that I wish I had read while I was still in school (of course, they might not have been out then!!). The list is ordered in the way 'I feel' they should be read. More specifically, I have focused on books that I think can equip people (alongside real world experience) to ['Build A Solid Core'](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/BuildASolidCore.aspx)

Here it is:

You'll notice that I have not even touched on specialized topics such as web/windows development,object relational mapping, or even sql. We'll save that list for another day. I have also [published this as a listmania list to Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R39PW96KKNBR79/ref=cm_lm_pthnk_view/103-5653998-1688625?ie=UTF8&lm%5Fbb=).

Happy Reading.
