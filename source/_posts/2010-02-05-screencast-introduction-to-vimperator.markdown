As someone who loves to leverage mouseless computing as often as possible, I thought I would take the time to share a screencast introducing one of the may tools that I use to "go mouseless".   
This screencast is a gentle introduction to the basics of [vimperator](http://vimperator.org/); which is a plug-in for [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) that allows you to browse the web without the constraints of a mouse!!   
This is one of the first times that I have recorded a screencast in [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp) and not recorded directly to avi. This allowed me the option to do some post production (very minor). I would appreciate any feedback you would be willing to give on the technical aspects of the video:   
-Video Quality    
-Lighting     
-Sound     
-....   
I had a lot of fun making this screencast and am looking forward to producing many more videos over the course of the year. I can't promise that they will all be technical, but I hope you will find a handful of them informative!!   
As you can see from the format of the screencast, I am typing along as I am walking through the features. This is my preferred style of delivery. The only thing that I omitted from this screencast is to have the keys that I am typing being displayed. Please feel free to let me know if you would like the keys to be displayed for successive screencasts.   <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:24B000F9-17C4-4a32-AE6A-E830F7896C68:78317c2c-a305-4b15-bf00-896008f2e976" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="http://az2193.vo.msecnd.net/feb-2010-07-intro-to-vimperator/Default.html" Width="822" Height="411"></iframe></div>
