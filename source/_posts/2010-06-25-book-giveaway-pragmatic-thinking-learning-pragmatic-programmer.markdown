Have you been struggling with learning new concepts at work? Are you feeling overwhelmed by the constant flood of information that keeps coming at you from all angles? Do you constantly find yourself reading new books yet being unable to retain/apply any of the information that you have read. It might just be time to debug your brain!!

Pragmatic Thinking and Learning is one of those books that falls into my category of "Career Catalyst". These are books that when read and applied can have a lasting impact on how you go about executing your career. This book will help you identify your current style of learning, as well as give you techniques and exercises that you can use to identify and fix errors in your own thinking that may be preventing you from reaching your full potential when it comes to continuous
learning.

The Pragmatic Programmer is another one of those books that falls into the "Career Catalyst" category. In my opinion, any student entering a computer science/technology field should be provided this book as one of their first to read. If you can digest and apply the concepts outlined in this book it will provide you with a set of habits that will enable you to be a developer who charts a steady upward course with your career. I have spoken with lots of developers who have read this
book, and yet they have not taken the time to apply the concepts to their own career. If you have not read the book, or you are in the category of people who have read it but not really applied it, then there is no better time to start than today.

One of my goals when I am teaching is to encourage people to start thinking about how they can "chart their own course" and focus on finding a rhythm that enables them to learn new concepts in a JIT fashion, while also not becoming overwhelmed with the continual flood coming at them. I personally feel that the information contained in these two books can become instrumental in helping people figure out what it means for themselves to become more productive programmers.

If you have not read either one of both of these books, here is an opportunity. The first 5 people to email me will receive amazon credit (applicable to amazon.com) with which they can purchase a copy of both of these amazing books (you will have to take care of shipping costs).
