This year has truly been a year where my family and I can say that Nothin But .Net officially went global (having ventured into other parts of Europe as well as the Dominican Republic). We are extremely thankful to God for the amazing opportunities He has opened up for us and the many amazing people that we have been able to meet along the way.

Not content to stop there, Lord willing, next year we are going to step out to take the course into other locations that have been making requests for the course. The plan for next year is to hit the following new countries:
<ul>
  <li>Australia</li>

  <li>Cambodia</li>

  <li>India</li>
</ul>

As well as the countries that we have already been and love:
<ul>
  <li>Canada</li>

  <li>US</li>

  <li>England</li>

  <li>Germany</li>

  <li>Dominican Republic</li>
</ul>

If you live in one of those countries and have suggestions about where demand for the course might be, please feel free to get in [contact](mailto:jp@developwithpassion.com) with me.

If your company is thinking that they would like to get some training done in the new year, we have also hosted several private iterations of the bootcamp. So feel free to [contact](mailto:jp@developwithpassion.com) me if that is something you might be interested in.

Why the drive to hit all these places? It might sound a little cheesy, but I have seen this course change lives (literally) and the emotions around that are something that are very difficult to express in words. I want to take this course to as many places as possible and prayerfully have as much of a positive impact on the lives and careers of many other developers.

Cambodia in particular is going to be exciting because I have been informed that they do not have access to any significant advanced training there, and the cost of the typical courses elsewhere is much too prohibitive. I am working with people there to ensure that the course can be bought to them with a cost that will work within their typical developer budget and allow as many people as possible to participate in what could be a great experience for them.

Hopefully I will see you in 2009!!

Develop With Passion!!
