This is a library to aid in the usage of [fakes](http://github.com/developwithpassion/fakes) when using [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec). It adds a bunch of convienience methods and matchers to aid in the usage of the heavily AAA style isolation library.

##Installation
{% codeblock Installing - install.sh %}
gem install fakes-rspec
{% endcodeblock %}

Or (preferably using bundler), in your gemfile:
{% codeblock Bundler - gemfile.rb %}
source "http://rubygems.org"
gem 'fakes-rspec'
{% endcodeblock %}

When you install the gem it will install the rspec gem also, so you will immediately ready to go.

##Usage

##Creating a fake

###Using a let block
{% codeblock  Let Initialization - let.rb %}
describe "Some Feature" do
  let(:my_fake){fake}
end
{% endcodeblock %}

###Inline
{% codeblock  Inline Initialization - inline.rb %}
describe "Some Feature" do
  it "should be able to create a fake" do
    item = fake
  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}

##Configuring a fake with return values for calls

###Irrespective of arguments:
{% codeblock  Faking Return Values Regardless Of Arguments - code.rb %}
it "should be able to setup a fakes return values" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.stub(:hello).and_return("World")

  fake.hello.should == "World"
  fake.hello("There").should == "World"
end
{% endcodeblock %}

###Caring about arguments:
{% codeblock  Faking Return Values With Specific Sets Of Arguments - specific_arguments.rb %}
it "should be able to setup a fakes return values" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.stub(:hello).with("There").and_return("World")
  fake.stub(:hello).with("You").and_return("Again")

  fake.stub(:hello).and_return("Does Not Matter") # when you use the catch_all, make sure that it is the last step used for a particular method (as above)

  fake.hello("There").should == "World"
  fake.hello("You").should == "Again"
  fake.hello.should == "Does Not Matter"
end
{% endcodeblock %}

##Determining whether a call was made

One of the big strengths of this library compared to some of the other ruby isolation libraries is the ability to let you make assertions against the fake after the [subject] has run its code. The following examples demonstrate some typical usage scenarios:

###Irrespective of arguments:
{% codeblock  Verifying Call Made Ignoring Arguments - call_verify_ignoring_arguments.rb %}
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should have_received(:hello) #true
end
{% endcodeblock %}

###With a specific set of arguments:

{% codeblock  Verifying Calls Made With Specific Arguments - verifying_calls_made_with_specific_arguments.rb %}
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should have_received(:hello,"World") #true
  fake.should have_received(:hello,"Other") #false
end
{% endcodeblock %}

Remember, that because it is just a matcher, to negate the matcher you can use the should_not qualifier to do the opposite:

###Determine whether a call was not made with a specific set of arguments:
{% codeblock  Verifying A Call Was Not Made With A Specific Set Of Arguments - not_made_with_specific_arguments.rb %}
it "should be able to determine if a call was not made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should_not have_received(:hello,"Other") #true
end
{% endcodeblock %}

##Determining that a call was made a certain number of times

###Irrespective of arguments:
{% codeblock  Verifying Occurences Of A Call Ignoring Arguments - verifying_occurences_ignoring_arguments.rb %}
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should have_received(:hello).once #true
end
{% endcodeblock %}

###Caring about arguments:
{% codeblock  Verifying Occurences Of A Call Including Arguments - verifying_occurences_including_arguments.rb %}
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should have_received(:hello,"World").once #true
  fake.should have_received(:hello,"Earth").once #false
end
{% endcodeblock %}

Remember, that because it is just a matcher, to negate the matcher you can use the should_not qualifier to do the opposite:

###Determine whether a call was not made a specific number of times with a specific set of arguments:
{% codeblock  lang:ruby %}
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should_not have_received(:hello,"World").twice #true
  fake.should_not have_received(:hello).twice #true
end
{% endcodeblock %}

After calling have_received, you can specify occurences using one of the following methods:

* once
* twice
* at_least_once
* at_least_twice
* at_most_once
* at_most_twice
* at_least(times)
* at_most(times)
* exactly(times)
* occurs(match_block) - Where match_block is a proc/lambda that matches the signature lambda{|number| bool}

An example of using the occurs method would be as follows:

###Determine whether a call was not made between a certain number of times
{% codeblock  Verifying Calls Using Occurs - occurs.rb %}
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")
  fake.hello("Again")

  fake.should have_received(:hello).occurs(lambda{|number| (1..3) === number}) #true
end
{% endcodeblock %}
