Time is running out to register for the [course](http://developwithpassion.com/training.oo) that will take place next week in Dusseldorf!!

It is shaping up to be another awesome event. If you have not heard about the event you can plan for the following (amongst many others):
<ul>
  <li>Long days filled with coding frenzies and lots of problem solving</li>

  <li>Great meals and conversations</li>

  <li>Great pair programming sessions</li>

  <li>Potential "motivation injection" (stealing a phrase from my friend Sean)</li>
</ul>
