Was just listening to one of my favorite [Newsboys](http://www.newsboys.com/) songs this morning and I thought I would share some of the lyrics:  
Stay strong   
You are not lost    
Come on and fix your eyes ahead    
There's a new dawn to light our day, our day    
We've gotta stay strong    
You and I run    
For the prize that lies ahead    
We've come too far to lose our way, our way   
Get up, there's further to go   
Get up, there's more to be done    
Get up, this witness is sure    
Get up, this race can be won    
This race can be won  
  
Good Advice if you ask me!!  
Develop With Passion!!
