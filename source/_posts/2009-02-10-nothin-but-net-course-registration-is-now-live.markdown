After a bit of a delay the registration for all of the 2009 Nothin But .Net courses is live. This year I have decided to go with [EventBrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/r/jpboodhoo), it is a really simple to use event management system with huge benefits over the Acteva system I was using last year!!  
To register for a course you can go to [www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo) and click on the link for any one of the courses on the left hand side of the page. This will take you to a registration page for the course.  
At this time, none of the venues have been chosen as we are still in discussions with most of the venues. This year we are also looking at options other than hotels (if you or someone you know has access to a venue that is close to hotels and can accommodate 17 people comfortably, feel free to contact me and we can discuss trading space for discounts!!).  
The following link is an rss feed for all training events hosted by developwithpassion.com: <a title="http://www.eventbrite.com/rss/user_list_events/80468363" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/rss/user_list_events/80468363">http://www.eventbrite.com/rss/user_list_events/80468363</a>  
Almost 600 people across the world have now taken this course!! It is an honour and a privilege for me to be able to share whatever experience and wisdom I have with the people who attend. The events are very casual, informative, professionally and personally challenging. My goal is not just to have you leave with strategies to become a better developer. I want you to leave feeling more empowered to live out your dreams for your life.  
I feel that God has imparted a blessing to countless developers who have taken this course, I am just glad to be a vehicle through which that blessing can be delivered.  
I look forward to meeting each and every new participant this year!!  
God Bless You and Develop With Passion!!
