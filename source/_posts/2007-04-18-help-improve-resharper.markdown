David Stennett over at JetBrains is soliciting existing users of ReSharper to pipe up and tell them about things they could do to improve the killer product we all know and love (all of us who use it that is!!).

Take a couple of minutes out of your busy day and fill out [this survey](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/quest.jsp) which should arm them with more information with which they can continue to improve the single biggest productivity booster to grace Visual Studio.
