Having thought that I had figured out my publishing issues, this should have been published last Friday!  
Here we are with the 2nd part to getting started with [git](http://git-scm.com/). This time around the focus is on using git in a collaborative scenario with the aid of [github](http://www.github.com). Some of the topics covered are as follows:   
-Configuring remote repositories    
-Cloning from a remote repository     
-Pushing changes back to a remote repository     
-Pulling changes from a remote repository     
-Brief overview of dealing with an actual merge conflict   
As before, any feedback that you would be willing to offer would be greatly appreciated.
