In November I had the wonderful honor and opportunity to record a podcast with [Craig Shoemaker of Polymorphic Podcast](http://polymorphicpodcast.com/) fame. There was not any one specific topic talked about but the conversation was definitely a lot of fun.

He has titled the show '[Develop with Passion like Jean-Paul Boodhoo](http://polymorphicpodcast.com/shows/developpassion/)'!! If passion is what came across in the interview then the interview was a definite success.

Develop With Passion!!
