I had the awesome honor of being [interviewed](http://dnic.ca/archive/2006/10/11/Jean_2D00_Paul-Boodhoo-on-Design-Patterns.aspx) by [John Bristowe](http://blogs.msdn.com/jbristowe/) on his great podcast [Developer Night In Canada](http://dnic.ca/default.aspx). The show was a general rant about design patterns and test driven development. The main focus was supposed to be on design patterns, unfortunately I got a little sidetracked and went on a general rant that caused the show to go much longer than its usual timeframe. If you can muddle through my blabbing I am pretty sure I was able to disperse a couple of good nuggets in there somewhere!! 
Any feedback is welcome!!
