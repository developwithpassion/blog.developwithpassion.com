[Michel Grootjans](http://geekswithblogs.net/alternativedotnet/archive/2008/09/17/125250.aspx) has very kindly organized a meet and greet social in Brussels for this coming Saturday the 20th of September.

It is going a be a very informal get together where there will hopefully be an opportunity to partake in lots of interesting conversations.

The venue is here: ‚ÅÉ [Sint-Gorikshallen: Sint-Goriksplein 1, 1000 Brussel](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Sint-Goriksplein+1,+1000+Brussel+&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=39.184175,93.164063&ie=UTF8&ll=50.847058,4.346895&spn=0.015282,0.04549&z=15) and we are going to kick things off at around 9:00PM.

If you are in and around the area, please stop by as I am sure that it will be a great evening.

From Brussels the next stop will be Dusseldorf for the next session of the [Nothin But .Net bootcamp](http://developwithpassion.com/training.oo)!!

Develop With Passion!!
