Sorry for the late notice. I will not be able to make it to Edmonton tomorrow to present on BDD.  
I apologize to all the people who were planning to come and see the topic. In my place [Donald Belcham](www.igloocoder.com) will be delivering a presentation on ORMâ€™s.  
I look forward to making it up to Edmonton at a future date to deliver the presentation!!  
  
Develop With Passion!!
