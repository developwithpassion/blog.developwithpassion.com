Thanks to the notification of Steve Nickerson, I have updated the original zip file that I released containing the source. This gets rid of a compile error that was present in the original source (I messed stuff up when I was prepping for deploying the zip)!! Download the latest code from [here]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/appliedTestDrivenDevelopmentPart3/appliedTestDrivenDevelopment3.zip) (the original link has been updated also). 
  
Thanks Steve.
