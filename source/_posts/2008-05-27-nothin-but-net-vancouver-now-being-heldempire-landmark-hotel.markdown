A venue change has occurred as the original hotel could not provide us with the room for the whole day on the Thursday!!  
The course in Vancouver next month is now going to be held at the [Empire Landmark Hotel](http://www.empirelandmarkhotel.com/). I am pretty excited, as the space we are being given is pretty spectacular.  
If you are planning on attending, sign up [here](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=150218). If you happen to book a room in the hotel itself (recommended) make sure that you mention that you are attending Nothin But .Net and you will receive a $30 discount on the room.  
I apologize for any inconvenience.  
Develop With Passion!!
