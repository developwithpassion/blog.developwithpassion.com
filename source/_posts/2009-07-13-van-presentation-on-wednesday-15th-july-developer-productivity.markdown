The folks at [VAN](http://virualaltnet.blogspot.com/2009/07/van-jean-paul-sylvain-boodhoo-in-town_12.html) were kind enough to give me the opportunity to speak on the topic of developer productivity. We are going to attempt to discuss factors that can prevent us from achieving betters levels of productivity in our workplace. Of course, I am sure there are going to be other topics that come up!!   
If you have time and are able to make it it would be great to have you join in on the conversation:   
Start Time: Wed, July 15, 2009 8:00 PM UTC/GMT -5 hours   
End Time: Wed, July 15, 2009 10:00 PM UTC/GMT -5 hours   
Develop With Passion!!
