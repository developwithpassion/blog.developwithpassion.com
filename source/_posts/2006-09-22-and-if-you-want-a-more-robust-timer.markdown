In my last post I created a simple class that wrapped around the Stopwatch class in the Framework. If you require a more robust implementation for your needs, check out the timer that [Vance Morrison](http://blogs.msdn.com/vancem/) has created. [His implementation](http://blogs.msdn.com/vancem/archive/2006/09/21/765648.aspx) allows for collecting stats from individual iterations as well as some other interesting features.
