This is a request for help, as I don’t want to have to reinstall studio unless I really have to. I’m not sure if I accidentally changed a font setting for dialogs in studio, but all of my dialogs look like this now:  
<a href="{{ site.cdn_root }}binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WhatsupwithmyVS2008install_98E0/image_4.png" rel="lightbox"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="343" alt="image" src="{{ site.cdn_root }}binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WhatsupwithmyVS2008install_98E0/image_thumb_1.png" width="561" border="0" /></a>   
My ide font is fine, and everything else seems to be ok, but any VS dialog that I bring up is having the text rendered the same way. I done a repair of the installation, but it’s still there. I wondering if I accidentally changed a font setting in VS that I was not aware of.  
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!!
