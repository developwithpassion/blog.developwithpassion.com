For the last couple of months, our son has been on a journey to explore the world of creating different styles of electronic dance music; with a strong preference toward house music.

It has been awesome to see him exploring this avenue of creative expression!

Here is a link to his first official song. As an extremely proud dad, I am excited to see what he is going to able to accomplish as he dives deeper into learning all of this cool stuff!!
