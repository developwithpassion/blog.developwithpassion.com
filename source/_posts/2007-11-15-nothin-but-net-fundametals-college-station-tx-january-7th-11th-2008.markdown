Nothin But .Net Fundamentals is coming to College Station, Texas for the week of January 7th-11th 2008.
<h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
<p class="itemBody"><span class="searchword">Nothin</span>' But .Net Fundamentals is a five day boot camp that will focus on teaching people a core understanding of how to get started developing with the .Net Framework. This course is intended as an introductory class for people who are getting started in .Net development.
<p class="itemBody">This course is all about <b>learning how to take control</b> of the .Net framework and having it work the way you want. This course <b>will</b> place a heavy emphasis on basic structures in the .Net framework getting back to the basics and making .Net do things the way you want it to, in a predictable and testable way. 
<p class="itemBody">This course will focus on a code centric view of application development vs. the typical databinding/designer magic covered by many typical .Net courses. You will walk away with a deep understanding of fundamental aspects of .Net and how these pieces can be used to develop and deliver enterprise scale applications.
