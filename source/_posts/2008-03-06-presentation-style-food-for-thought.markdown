I was just reviewing some of the feedback that I got from my presentation last week and the following comment was particularly important:  
"I think that creating the code on the fly during the presentations (even if you can type really fast) distracts from the central message being communicated. I think that 50% code, 50% powerpoint, with more fully pre-built examples could better achieve educational objectives"  
I have always struggled with this issue and if anyone has ever seen one of my presentation as of late they are familiar with what the equation is:  
Powerpoint - 0%  
On the fly coding with commentary - 85%  
Talking - 15%  
I am still on the fence with the above formula as it is a definite 50/50 split. You either love it or hate it.  
How do you learn best when you attend a presentation?
