It seems like quite a few people had trouble watching the videos for the last post that I made. Based on some good feedback I have decided to make it available for download as a flash file so that people can watch it at their leisure. The download file is a 50MB zip file that extracts to a swf (flash) file. 

If you have any problems accessing the files please let me know.

 
<ul>
<li>Download the flash video [here]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/automatingYourBuildsWithNAntPart8/AutomatingBuildPart8.zip)</li>
<li>I will post the google link once it is verified.</li></ul>
