Seeing the response from the Dream Giver giveaway, I thought I would try something a little bit different in an effort to get people to potentially look at updating their book library.  
Self education is an absolute must if you want to remain current in this industry, and IMHO there is no better resource that blogs and a couple of books to help you hit the ground running.  
If you are feeling like your book library could use a bit of an upgrade then email me. I will issue an $70 Amazon gift card to the:  <ul>   <li>77th, 78th, and 79th respondents</li> </ul>  
Develop With Passion!!
