[Geoff Stockham](http://www.stockham.co.uk/) asked a good question on my ["Dark Side Of Declaritive Databinding"](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/TheDarkSideOfDeclaritiveDatabinding.aspx) post. My comments for that post got all messed up so I am reposting the question for everyone to view, along with the answer: 

<em>Q:JP, I've just been flicking through the Wrox ASP.NET MVP Hacks book, and one of the sections is about inheriting from the built-in data sources (such as ObjectDataSuurce) to create more specific domain-based data sources. This set me to thinking that this may be a way to get a "best of both worlds" approach of testability and ease of use. I haven't looked into it yet, but wondered if this might be the way you were thinking?</em>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="2"><font face="Courier New">A: Once you start watching the series that I will be posting on applied test driven development, you will see why I have not found a need to take advantage of controls such as the object data source control. I am not discounting it as a viable solution to build apps with; it is just not the solution I go with. A decent MVP implementation coupled with test driven development, usually leads me down a path that diverges quite far from the solution offered by the object data source and the like.</font></font>
