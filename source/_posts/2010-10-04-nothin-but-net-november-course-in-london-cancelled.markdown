This is just a quick post to let people know that the [NBDN](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo) course that was scheduled for next month in London has been cancelled.

The reason for the cancellation is not enough numbers (1 person registered!!).

I am planning on coming back to the UK next year to deliver some more training courses. If you have been patiently waiting to attend a course, then keep posted to this blog as well as [http://www.developwithpassion.com]() to see a list of upcoming courses as they become available.

I apologize if this causes any inconvienience.

God Bless You.
