I just had an awesome comment made on my unit testing post by [Tom Opgenorth](http://www.opgenorth.net/). It was so good that I though it deserves a post in its own right!! Here it is:

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In trying to explain the "why" of TDD, I like the example of paying cash vs borrowing money.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Using TDD is paying cash.  You shell out the time (money) now, and all is good.  Your account is clear.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Without TDD it is like borrowing money to buy something.  You get what you want but there will come a time when you have to settle your debt, usually with interest.  </font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">From a code perspective, this interest is usurious:  wasted time spent digging through a debugger, hoping that a breakpoint was set a the right place in code so you can see the error happen.</font>

Awesome!! Thanks Tom.
