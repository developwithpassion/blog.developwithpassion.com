Just a quick post to share the fact that the first [Ruby Primer Bootcamp](http://developwithpassion.com/training/ruby/primer_bootcamp) that was held in Las Vegas last month was a huge success!!

Considering that the group was extremely small (to be expected for the first run) and that they all had experience with ruby (1 - 3 years). The challenge level received was significant and there was lots of amazing feedback from the course and it has strengthened my resolve to take this officially on the road as there is lots for even seasoned Ruby devs to learn.

The plan will be to deliver more of the Ruby Primer Bootcamps next year along with continuing to deliver the Develop With Passion - .Net Bootcamp.

My hope is that as awareness of the course and its challenging content grows, word of mouth will circulate and the class sizes will start to get bigger, which ultimately makes it a much richer environment for learning.

Here are some journal notes made by one of the attendees of the course:

* [software craftmanship](http://mokhan.ca/journal/2012/12/09/software-craftsmanship.html)
* [level up](http://mokhan.ca/journal/2012/12/13/level-up.html)

I feel blessed to be able to reach another set of developers with a set of approaches and techniques that do truly transcend language and platforms!
