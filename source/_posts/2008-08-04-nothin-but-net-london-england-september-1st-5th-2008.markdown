Now that lots of people are aware of the fact that my family and I are going to be in Europe for the months of August and September, there have been lots of questions about whether there would be a course in the UK while I was there. The [Germany course](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaID=150220) is already schedule for the 22nd of September. I did, however realize that it would be a shame not to open up the option in the event that there are people interested.  
To that end, there will be a [course in London](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaID=164699) for the first week of September. I just recently completed a private course in the Dominican Republic, that consisted of only 5 people. This experience has made me realize how awesome small class sizes can be. Since we are going to be in the UK, there will be no cancellation of the course even if there are only a handful of people able to attend on such short notice. I want to make sure that the people who have expressed strong interest are able to attend even if the numbers are not there (especially because of the short registration timeline!!  
If you want to find out more about the course check out this page : <a title="http://developwithpassion.com/training.oo" href="http://developwithpassion.com/training.oo">http://developwithpassion.com/training.oo</a>  
Registration for the course can be done [here](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaID=164699).  
Here are some of the comments from the last public course (June 2008, Vancouver):  
  
"I would just like to thank you for an excellent course! It's really gotten me out of a standstill development wise where I felt like I was just treading water and not moving forward. I feel like I have enough material to grow with for a long time."

"JP, for more, have a look at my [blog](http://www.umbyersw.com/2008/06/unofficial-nbdn-survival-guide.html) post. It has been totally refreshing to see how you have pursued your own style of coding regardless of what Microsoft has in mind. It was just as much of an inspiration to see what you have done in the patterns and practices that you are following, as it is to imagine that I am empowered to not only follow that same road but to create a path for myself! It was also amazing to see that so many of the other attendees were in the same boat as I was, and that talking with them would be so interesting. Aside from all of that, I could name more than a dozen of the technologies and techniques from your itinerary that I feel substantially more comfortable with and how they can all work together. Just as you recommend other resources as required training/reading for developers, this course is one of those things every developer should do. I rarely recommend training to colleagues, but this course has been so good on so many levels that I have already recommended it to many. Thank you very much for the time that you put in to the course and the attention and caring that you give it that makes it hands down the best .NET training course available."  
  
"It was great. It was intense. It took me two days to recover. I think it won't fully sink in for some time but I am a changed developer. It reaffirmed my identity as a developer. It has given me a renewed thirst for knowledge. It was amazing to spend so much time learning with others"  
  
"I got a lot out of the week. Some of the most valuable things I learnt this week were non-technical in nature. I was most impressed by your professional and positive attitude towards work and life. Your enthusiasm is definitely infectious and it was the first time that I have been to a class where the teacher was so dedicated and passionate about the subject matter. You have definitely had a big impact on everyone. I would recommend this course to others just to see an example of what a consultant should be like.    
There are some topics I would have liked to have seem more on:     
- techniques for WinForms/WPF development, since rich clients seem to be coming back into favour.     
- persistence and unit of work     
- more time on domain driven design principals, since I think creating a good domain model is not always easy"
