I have just finished recording the second session for the ATDD series. The video is approximately 37minutes in length. In this session all that I focus on is getting a presenter and accompanying view working to display a list of Contacts in the AdventureWorks database. Topics that are introduced are:
<ul>
<li>Constructor based dependency injection</li>
<li>Interface based programming</li>
<li>RhinoMocks for creating mock objects</li></ul>

The completed code and movie are in [this torrent]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/appliedTestDrivenDevelopmentForWebApplicationsPart2/appliedTestDrivenDevelopmentPart2.torrent).

Any feedback/comments would be greatly appreciated.
