[Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/12/04/announcing-the-release-of-the-first-wpf-e-ctp.aspx) just announced on his blog the public community preview of WPF/E. 
If they are pitching this as a flash killer, then from first impressions (given the fact that it runs on Firefox, IE, and Safari) I would say they have taken an incredible step in the right direction. 
Install it and play around with the samples. Make sure to check out the demos listed on Scott's blog. 
On my machine (Windows Vista) installing the SDK did not allow me to run the samples, so I also installed the CTP of the runtime which can be found [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A3E29817-F841-46FC-A1D2-CEDC1ED5C948&displaylang=en). 
Enjoy.
