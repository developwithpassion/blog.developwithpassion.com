After lots of months of planning discussions and idea tennis; I am pleased and proud to announce my good friend Jonathan Rasmusson has come on board the Nothin But * Training banner. He comes armed with his own Agile Project Management training course that I am positive is going to take the market by storm.

People who know me are aware of the fact that I am very picky about the people that I choose to work and collaborate with. I need to ensure that the training delivered to people who engage developwithpassion.com and the Nothin But * brand is of the highest quality, taught by active practitioners in the field. Having worked with Jonathan on projects in the past, I can personally attest to his level of excellence in the arena of Agile Project Management.

If there was ever a time that you though you needed to get an idea for what it truly means to run an agile project, March will be a good time to check out the beauty of Calgary whilst immersing yourself in what will definitely be an amazing week of agile deep diving!!
