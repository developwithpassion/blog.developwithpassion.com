Since my family and I are committed to doing the traveling thing for the next year, I thought the least I could do would be to try and share our experiences as time permits!! So expect a lot of post with the same prefix for the title!!

Last week ( week of July 7th) my family and I took a little one week break in our journey to get to Orlando and spent the week at an amazing place called [Panama City Beach](http://www.pcbeach.org/).

It was a working week for me so I changed my schedule slightly to the following:

-Wake up at 6:00AM

-Work from 6:00AM to 8:00AM

-Workout from 8:00AM to 9:00AM

-Carry on working from 9:00AM until 2:00PM

At 2:00PM I was free to chill out with my family and enjoy the amazing beach and swim in the first truly (near clear) ocean that we have ever experienced as a family. One day we rented a Pontoon Boat and ventured out to a place called Shell Island. This was an amazing experience, running on the sand on that island caused our feet to make a noise that sounded like you were running in wet wellingtons! We ran across the island which opened up to the Gulf of Mexico. It was truly a magical experience that we will all remember forever.

Now I am sure that people are thinking, "How could he work in a place like that?". Don't feel too bad for me. I spent my entire time coding from the balcony of our room overlooking the ocean. I thought to myself "this is a great office!!" I have never got so much fresh air as well as be coding at my computer in a long time!!

For boys night out (every Thursday night I take my 3 sons out for a special event, while my wife takes our daughter out) we did go kart racing at Hidden Lagoon Go Kart Racing. The track itself is 0.90miles, so it was a lot of fun racing around it!!

We also got to take in 2 movies while we were there. My wife and I went out on a date night on the Friday we were there and we ended up going to the movie Get Smart. It was truly a hilarious movie, and I was surprised to see that it was a Mel Brooks endeavor. I love Mel Brooks films, but this one had a different style of funny to it than his traditional fare!! My wife's brother is accompanying us on our travels for the next 3 weeks, so we are leveraging him to be able to get a few date nights in while we can!!! The other movie that I saw was Journey To The Center of the Earth (with the kids) while my wife and brother went to Hancock. Journey to the Center of the Earth was a very good kids movie, the kids laughed out loud in may parts, and I thought it was a lot of fun.

On the Sunday we repacked the van and headed for Orlando. We started driving at 11:00AM and arrived in Orlando at 7:45PM!! It is now that my vacation truly begins (as I won't be doing any work now until the 9th of August!!!).
