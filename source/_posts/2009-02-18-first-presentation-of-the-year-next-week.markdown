The awesome gang up in [Edmonton](http://www.edmug.net/Home/tabid/137/Default.aspx) has invited me to come next week (February 26th) to give a presentation on Behavior Driven Development.  
It has been quite a long time since I have spoken in Edmonton, but the people there are great and there is always good conversation to be had during and after the presentations.  
If you are in and around the Edmonton area next week feel free to drop in at:  
Milner Public Library, 6th Floor, Room 7 @ 6:00PM  
Develop With Passion!!
