Now that I have finally figured out my publishing issue; here is the first screencast in a multi part series on using [git](http://git-scm.com/). This series is also part of the prep package for students who will be attending the [NBDN](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training.oo) courses this year.   
This is a 27 minute introduction that covers the main core of working with a local install of git. In the next episode I will be covering how to setup a [github](http://github.com/) account and working with git collaboratively using github.   
The topics covered in the video include:   
-Installing [msysgit](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) (basic installation)     
-Creating a local git repository     
-Adding and committing files     
-Creating and switching between branches     
-Branch isolation     
-Merging features from one branch to another     
-Rolling back changes to a branch   
Once again, any feedback that you can provide on the video will be greatly appreciated. The most significant issue of the last screencast was the playback resetting at a certain point in the video (this could be bypassed by manually dragging the time slider). If anyone encounters the reset issue during this video, please let me know.
