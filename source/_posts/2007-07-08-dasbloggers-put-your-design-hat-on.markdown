In the spirit of promoting more community involvement around dasBlog, [Ben Scheirman](http://www.flux88.com/)<font color="#0066cc"> </font>is [hosting a contest](http://www.flux88.com/dasBlogThemeContest.aspx) to see who can come up with the coolest theme for dasBlog.

As well as the winner walking away with a $100, this contest can serve as a good introduction to the way that dasBlog implements its skinning architecture.

If you are feeling artistic, or you are in need of some cash to buy a new book, spend a couple of hours and get your theme submission into the contest.

Happy designing!!
