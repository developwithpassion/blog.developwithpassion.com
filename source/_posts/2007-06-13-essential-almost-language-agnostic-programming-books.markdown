[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) [posted](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SixEssentialLanguageAgnosticProgrammingBooks.aspx) about six essential language agnostic programming books. I agree on not being bound to one language. Currently my most used language is C#. 

A while ago I created an Amazon listmania called Building a Solid Core, that focuses on a bunch of language agnostic books mixed in with some killer C# books.

Check it out [here](http://www.amazon.com/Building-A-Solid-Programming-Core-with-a-Net-slant/lm/R39PW96KKNBR79/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full/105-9265550-3828435), as I feel that all of the titles on the list are essential reading.
