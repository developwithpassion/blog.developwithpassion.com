Been a while since I posted an entry!! Tonight I am going to be presenting in downtown Calgary at the Alberta EUB meeting room. The presentation will be a 101 on the usage of common design patterns. If you are in and around the area feel free to drop in and check it out!! The presentation starts at 5:00PM and ends at 7:00PM. 

Look forward to seeing you there.
