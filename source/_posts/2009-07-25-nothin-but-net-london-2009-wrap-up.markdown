Just got back from another amazing course in London, England. The class was great. As always I think I learned just as much from the students as I was able to impart to them. There were 15 of us in total, and with each successive course I am trying to find a way to get the students engaging in as much practical lab exercises as possible. There came a point where people felt that it may have been too much lab exercise and that they were not getting enough guidance. This feedback allowed me to make some adjustments. On day 4 and 5 the feedback from the auto correcting seemed to register well with people.   
I would like to take this time to thank my London class for the honor of being able to share that instance week of training them. I look forward to seeing what the future holds in store for all of you!!   
God Bless You,
