Yesterday I had the wonderful opportunity to present a talk on Generics to the Austin .Net user group. The session was a whirlwind of code and questions. I was honored to be received by such a large group of people. And I would like to thank [Jeff](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/) and the [Austin .Net user group](http://www.adnug.org/) for allowing me to give my first formal talk in the United States!! Seeing as how I am going to be giving several talks in the states this year, it was fitting that the first one would leave me with such a positive feeling.

I made a mistake and did not check in the code that I developed over the course of the presentation, so the code base that you can download is not representative of all of the information  that was covered over the 2 hour session.

Once again, thanks Austin .Net for allowing me to opportunity to come and share an awesome time with you.
