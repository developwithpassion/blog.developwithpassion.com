One of the things I have really enjoyed doing a lot this year has been presenting at different user groups across Canada. One of my roles as a consultant is to often give ad-hoc presentations to groups in and around the city of Calgary, introducing them to topics that they may not be particularly familiar with. 
In November I will be taking part in a small MSDN Speakers Tour (I think that is what they are called) and I will be making stops in Winnipeg, Regina, and Saskatoon. The tour dates are November 6th,7th, and 8th. The main focus of the presentations will be to dive into design patterns, test driven development, and possibly patterns of enterprise application architecture. 
Here is the actual schedule (times will be updated as soon as possible): <ul> <li>Regina .Net User Group - 6th November - Topic: Patterns for building an Object Relational Mapping Layer in .Net</li> <li>Winnipeg .Net User Group - 7th November - Topic: Design Patterns - An Introduction</li> <li>Saskatoon .Net User Group - 8th November - Topic : TBD</li></ul> 
If you happen to be out and about (and in these cities) feel free to attend, give feedback and say hi!!
