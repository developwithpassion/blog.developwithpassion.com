I guess I have been a little too heads down in coding frenzy mode to realize that I missed the release of [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) 2.0 4 days ago.  
This release adds a whole bunch of stability enhancements along with some killer features that now make it a much more feature complete offering:  <ul>   <li>Virtual Hard Disk Resizing</li>    <li>Multiple Snapshots and decent snapshot manager</li>    <li>Multiple monitor support!!</li> </ul>  
There are so many new features that I would not be able to do it justice by bullet pointing it here, so head over [here](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) and check it out and download it if you are still using V1.0!!
