After a couple of days of searching for a venue (at such short notice) the St. Bride Foundation has been selected. It is located at the following address:
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica">ST BRIDE FOUNDATION
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica">Bride Lane Fleet Street
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica">London EC4Y 8EQ
<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica">

<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica">If you want to find out more information about the venue check out the following website:

<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica">

<p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica">Because of the size of the venue (and shorter registration timeline) the registration limit for the course is going to be set at only 10 people. This will fall inline with the same class that occurred last year in London (which had about 10 people).
