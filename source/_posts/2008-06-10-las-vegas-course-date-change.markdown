Thanks to the attentive eye of Phil Haselden I have recently changed the date of the October edition of [Nothin But .Net](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=150221) so that it no longer conflicts with Microsoft PDC.

The course will now run the week prior to PDC (20th - 24th).

Develop With Passion!!
