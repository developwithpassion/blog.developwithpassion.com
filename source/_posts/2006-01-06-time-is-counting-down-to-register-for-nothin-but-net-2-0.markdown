For all who may be interested. On the week of February 6th - 10th I will be holding a .Net 2.0 Bootcamp in Calgary,AB.

The event will be held at [CTC TrainCanada in Calgary](http://www.traincanada.com/northamerica/index.cfm?getWhat=main.trainingCentres&CFID=12974&CFTOKEN=70784657).

It will be an intense week of getting up to speed on building enterprise level applications with the .Net 2.0 Framework. You can view the course outline [here]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/timeIsCountingDownToRegisterForNothinButNet20/outline.pdf) and if you are interested in attending you can register [here](http://traincanada.com/bitwise).

Look forward to seeing you there.
