Thanks to the audio and video expertise of [Carl Franklin](http://www.franklins.net/), a new show has been posted on [DNRTv](http://www.dnrtv.com/) where I try to give a more complete example of test driven development in action. It's funny, when I went through the demo on my own machine, I was able to get through all of the code within one hour. Once we actually started to record the show we realized that we would need to break it up into 2 recordings. And even then I was only able to demonstrate the first part of the example!! It was a lot of fun and I hope that lots of people watch and give feedback as to what they see. You can watch the latest episode [here](http://www.dnrtv.com/), and I will also be giving a talk on [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) next week, related to the episode that we just shot.
