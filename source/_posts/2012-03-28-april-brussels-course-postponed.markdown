I am sorry to announce that next month's .Net Software Craftmanship BootCamp in Brussels, has been rescheduled until the week of September 17th.

Being our first time in Brussels, we are hoping that pushing back the date will provide more people with an opportunity to convince their bosses that the course is a good investment!

I apologize for any inconvienience this may cause.

God Bless You.
