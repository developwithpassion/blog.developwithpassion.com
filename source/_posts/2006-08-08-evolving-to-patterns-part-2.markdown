Next week (August 15th), I will be participating in a double-header presentation with [James Kovacs](http://www.jameskovacs.com), at the [Calgary .Net User Group](http://www.calgaryug.net). I will start off the evening with a continuation of my Evolving to Patterns presentation, and James will follow up with a presentation on Windows CardSpace. Currently the web site does not indicate that this will be a combo presentation, I am sure that is being fixed as I write this!!

If you are in and around the area that night, stop by and check out the presentation/eat the food.
