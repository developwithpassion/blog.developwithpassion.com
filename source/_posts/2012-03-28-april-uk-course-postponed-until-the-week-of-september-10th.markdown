I am sorry to announce that next month's .Net Software Craftmanship BootCamp in the UK, has been rescheduled until the week of September 10th.

Since we only come to the UK once a year, we are hoping that pushing back the date will provide more people with an opportunity to convince their bosses that the course is a good investment!

I apologize for any inconvienience this may cause.

God Bless You.
