I was just listening to one of my favorite [podcasts](http://www.djsteveboy.com/podrunner.html) (sorry, not anything remotely technical) and the title for the newest track caught my eye as it is definitely something that I try to encourage everyone to do:

The title of the mix is Press on with the following description:

<strong>Press on to start, press on to keep from stopping
</strong>

Good advice for anyone who wants to find satisfaction in what they do.

<strong>Develop With Passion!!</strong>
