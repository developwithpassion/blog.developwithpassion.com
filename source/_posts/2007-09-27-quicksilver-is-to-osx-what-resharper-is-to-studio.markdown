As cool as I think OSX is, now that I have been exposed to QuickSilver, I find myself facing the same situation that I do when I am facing a VS installation without ReSharper. I can't use it without it!!

I think that only people who have actually coded with ReSharper can appreciate what I mean by this comment!!
