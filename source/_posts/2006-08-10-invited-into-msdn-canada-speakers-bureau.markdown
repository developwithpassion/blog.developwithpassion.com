Due to my lack of posts lately, I am sure that most people have realized that I have been extremely busy for the last couple of weeks. Along with vacation, I am also trying to secure a good contract that I can jump into. So obviously my efforts are currently focused around securing an income for the family !!!

Amidst the hustle and bustle, it is a great honor to be able to announce that I have been invited to become a member of the MSDN Canada Speakers bureau!! This means that user groups around Canada can now ask to have me come and speak at their meetings and (from what I gather) have the event covered by Microsoft!!

As far as topics go, here is an initial list of some presentations I could deliver:
<ul>
<li>Refactoring - An Introduction</li>
<li>Test Driven Development In .Net - An Introduction</li>
<li>Test Driven Development With Mock Objects</li>
<li>Dependency Inversion Principle & Dependency Injection</li>
<li>Model View Presenter - A Better Way To Factor Your Presentation Layer</li>
<li>Patterns For Building An ORM in .Net</li>
<li>Design Patterns - An Introduction</li>
<li>Applied Continuous Integration with NAnt & CruiseControl .Net</li>
<li>Generics - They're not just for collections</li>
<li>Applying Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</li>
<li>Winforms test automation with NUnitForms</li>
<li>Refactoring with ReSharper</li></ul>

If you are interested in having me speak at one of your user groups, feel free to get in contact with me!!
