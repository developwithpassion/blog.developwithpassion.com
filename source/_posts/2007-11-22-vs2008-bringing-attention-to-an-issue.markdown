Well, today I installed VS2008 on my machine. Setup went great and completed with no errors.

This was a fresh install on a machine that had no prior beta bits installed whatsoever. So I did not anticipate anything weird happening.

Fired up VS2008 for the first time and  it went through its normal first time setup deal. So there I was, in a blank IDE with my C# RSS Feed showing from the help page.

I go to add a new project and I'm presented with this wonderful dialog:

<img alt="" src="{{ site.cdn_root }}binary/2007/november/22/vs2008BringingAttentionToAnIssue/UnexpectedError.png" border="0" />

Ok.... So I try a few (lot) more menu items and the same thing happens. So, I think to myself, just exercise the standard Windows remedy. Get out, get back in, and see if it is better!!

I would do that, if I could exit Studio!! Even hitting the big red x in the top right corner of VS2008 pops up this dialog. The only way to shut this down is to kill the devenv process.

I am currently running XP with SP2 and an existing installation of VS2005. Again, let me stress that I have not installed any beta bits of VS2008.

After un installing and reinstalling to no success (same result) I quickly googled. I happened to [stumble into an MSDN forum ](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2447748&SiteID=1)where people are having the same issue and are also not sure how to go about resolving it.

Has anyone else ran into this issue? How did you fix it?
