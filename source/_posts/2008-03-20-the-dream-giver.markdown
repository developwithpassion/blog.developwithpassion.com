Having recommended this book to a couple of friends I thought I would take the time to write my 2 cents on what could potentially be a life changing book for many people. While reading this book it continually reminded me of the wonders that God has in store when you step out of your comfort zone to follow "Your Big Dream".  
For the people reading this blog who do not care much for the Christian influence in the book, don't let that discourage you from what could be an amazing read and inspiration. I am positive that you will still be able to read the book and empathize with a lot with the trials and tribulations of the main character as he pursues his big dream.  
Read the following blurb that will hopefully get the engines cranked for you to go out and read the book:  
<strong>_________________________________________________________________</strong>  
<strong>Are you living your dream&#8212; or just living your life? </strong>  
<strong>Welcome to a little story about a very big idea. This compelling modern-day parable tells the story of Ordinary, who dares to leave the Land of Familiar to pursue his Big Dream. </strong>  
<strong>You, too, have been given a Big Dream. One that can change your life. One that the Dream Giver wants you to achieve. Does your Big Dream seem hopelessly out of reach? Are you waiting for something or someone to make your dream happen? </strong>  
<strong>Then you're ready for The Dream Giver. </strong>  
<strong>Let Bruce Wilkinson show you how to rise above the ordinary, conquer your fears, and overcome the obstacles that keep you from living your Big Dream. </strong>  
<strong>You were made for this. Now it's time to begin your journey. </strong>
