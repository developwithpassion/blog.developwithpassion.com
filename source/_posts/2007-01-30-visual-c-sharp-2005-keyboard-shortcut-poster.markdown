If, like me, you are a keyboard junkie wanting to sharpen you keyboarding skills in VS 2005 you might appreciate [this PDF](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c15d210d-a926-46a8-a586-31f8a2e576fe&DisplayLang=en) that contains the default keybinding for Visual C# 2005. Thanks to Lucio Assis for providing me with the link!! 
This is a great place to start getting more proficient navigating around studio without the mouse. If you really want to take your keyboarding skills in studio to the next level do yourself a favour and pick up a copy of [JetBrains ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/Resharper), then you can really start to fly.
