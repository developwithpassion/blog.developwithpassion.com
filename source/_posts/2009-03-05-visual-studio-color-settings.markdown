I had someone a couple of days ago ask for my Visual Studio color settings. I got mine original settings by using the ones provided by [John Lam](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/vibrant_ink_vis.html). I did this mostly because of switching to vim and wanting to check out what his _vimrc file looked like. I fell in love with the color scheme and have been using it.  
I canâ€™t remember what (if any changes I made to mine) so I just went ahead and exported my current color settings.  
You can download them from [here]({{ site.cdn_root }}binary/2009/march/5/visual_studio_color_settings/develop_with_passion.rar).
