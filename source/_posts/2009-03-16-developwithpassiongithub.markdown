With my comfort level with Git rounding the “not so uncomfortable” I decided to throw myself in heads first and move the code that I currently have hosted on assembla over to [GitHub](http://github.com). All of the code samples that I publish now are going to be under the [“Develop With Passion”](http://github.com/developwithpassion) banner.  
GitHub is an easy choice as it makes the collaboration story much richer for people who potentially want to contribute changes to any of the source code that will live up there (as soon as I’m finished this startup at the end of April, my first task list item is to get much more code up there!!).   
Currently the only project that is hosted up there is : [developwithpassion.bdd](http://github.com/developwithpassion/developwithpassion.bdd)  
If you are unfamiliar with Git and its associated set of tools I am going to point you in the direction of an awesome [post](http://codebetter.com/blogs/aaron.jensen/archive/2009/03/12/hosting-your-oss-project-on-github.aspx) that [Aaron](http://codebetter.com/blogs/aaron.jensen) put together which should be instrumental in getting you up and running. If you want to quickly get up to speed on git (on windows) I would recommend the following resources (Aaron mentions most of these in his post also):  <ul>   <li>[An Illustrated Guide To Git On Windows](http://nathanj.github.com/gitguide/putty.html)</li>    <li>[Getting Started With Git And GitHub On Windows](http://kylecordes.com/2008/04/30/git-windows-go/)</li>    <li>[Git](http://git-scm.com/)</li>    <li>[Git Ready](http://gitready.com/)</li>    <li>[GitCasts](http://www.gitcasts.com/)</li> </ul>  
Develop With Passion!!
