The Develop With Passion® 2013 course schedule is now [online](http://developwithpassion.eventbrite.com)!

Currently the course load is small, but you can expect to see additions as Jon and I coordinate further iterations of the [Gamecrash](http://www.developwithpassion.com/training/game_crash) bootcamp over the course of the year.

My personal course load for this year is cut down a little as our family is looking forward to a bit more time at home this year. Personally, I will be hosting courses in the following locations:

* Calgary,AB
* Denver, CO
* San Diego, CA
* Manchester, UK
* Brussels, Belgium
* Nashville, TN
* Philadelphia, PA
* Edmonton, AB

This year I will also be mixing in more occurences of the Ruby Primer bootcamp, as the first iteration proved to be very successful.

With the [announcement](http://jonbho.net/2012/12/25/gamecrash-new-hyper-intensive-game-development-boot-camps/) that Jon made about the Gamecrash bootcamp, we are looking forward to a flood of new students excited to get into the world of game programming.

Develop With Passion® looks forward, and is honoured, to be a part in kickstarting/reginiting the passion in the 2013 class!!
