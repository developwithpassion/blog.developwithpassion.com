One of the statements that I caught myself saying this week that sounded very much like a contradiction is:

>KISS is hard work!!

Any programmer can sit down and hack out a solution that uses clever language constructs, premature optimization, generalization ... It takes discipline, hard work, and consistency to keep a code base in a state that allows the code to stay as relatively simple as possible.

I do believe that writing code test first can definitely aid you in the process of keeping things simple, as you are usually trying to focus on small chunks of functionality at a time. Of course this is one of many possible techniques.

What are some tactics that you use to "keep it simple" in your codebases/environments.

On a related note, what strategies do you use to enable your team as a collective to work together to keep things simple.
