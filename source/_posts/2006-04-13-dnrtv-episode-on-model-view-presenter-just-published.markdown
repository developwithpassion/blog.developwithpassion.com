A new episode that I recorded with Carl Franklin on DNRTv is now available for [viewing](http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showID=14). The show is a breakdown of implementing the Model View Presenter design pattern. I chose, based on feedback, to focus solely on the use of the pattern. This should help people who were feeling cluttered by the test-driven-development!! Of course, when I am developing applications, I always pragmatically apply test driven development. So to answer your question, yes I would have used TDD to drive out the functionality of the view and presenter as opposed to the ad-hoc coding that I did on the current show. 

One of my goals for this blog, is to be an outlet to show the practical applicability of TDD, design patterns etc, in the building and architecting of enterprise applications. I also have screen recording software available on my machine, so if there are topics you would like me to VBLOG about, as opposed to hogging all the DNRTv slots, then please let me know and I will do my best to record a quick screencast on the topic. 

I would finally like to thank all of the people who have taken the time to provide feedback both positive and negative. It is greatly appreciated.
