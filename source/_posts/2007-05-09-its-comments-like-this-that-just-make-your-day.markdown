I have been having a bit of a hectic week. In the midst of the insanity, I just opened up a message in my inbox that was received from a student of a course I just taught in Regina.

<font face="Calibri" size="3">As a mentor, there is no greater feeling that when you feel you have truly impacted another person with the knowledge you have shared. Here is what he had to say in the closing comments of the course feedback form:</font>

<font face="Calibri" color="#0000ff" size="3">Nothin But Dot Net was the best rock concert ever. No fancy light shows, dancing girls, pyro or over paid aging rockers. Just gigs of Dot Net agiled in soothing keys of ReSharper. </font>

<font face="Calibri" color="#0000ff" size="3">Too many encores to count! Nothin But Dot Net played longer. And then longer. And then even longer. Guitars were smashed, fans passed out, speakers blew up, the police came and the band even bought the audience pizza. </font>

<font face="Calibri" color="#0000ff" size="3">After sixty hours with only a few spared for sleep, the cover songs started. It was like we were hearing for the very first time what the original artists were trying to say. At times the crowd sang along, other times we stood in humbled awe through blistering solos and soaring ballads. Then the guitar was handed out to each of us and we got to jam with the IAxeMan himself. </font>

My only disappointment is that I didn't get into this music sooner.</font></span>
