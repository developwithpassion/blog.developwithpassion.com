The road lays out ahead of you. You can’t see your goal in sight, you just know it is waiting to be attained.   
It is not important how long you will travel this road for, or how many obstacles you are going to have to overcome. You just know that without this pursuit, nothing in your life will be the same. How much do you want it? Are you willing to put in the enormous effort. Are you ready to start your marathon today?   
If you start too fast and don’t set yourself a steady pace, you can risk burning out too early and not achieving your goal. On the other hand if you start off slow and don’t try to continually push yourself, you may find you reach your destination much later than your liking. Find your rhythm, a pace that works for you. Don’t get distracted by the sprinters speeding by you, and don’t get too confident if you start to leave people in your wake, as you might get complacent. Compete against yourself daily.  
The road lays out ahead of you. You can’t see your goal in sight, you just know it is waiting to be attained. You take the first step, and then the other. You have started the marathon. After a long time running it is easy to get discouraged and sidetracked. Thoughts of giving up can sometimes consume you when you are running through the desert on your own. These times are there to test you, and to keep you humble.  
Over time you will realize that the goal you thought was the goal may not be what you were expecting. Along the way I pray you will have the realization that the real goal of this “marathon” is the journey itself. Take time to breathe in your surroundings. Cherish the people you will meet on the way. Give encouragement to those who need encouragement. Share your “water” with those who are “thirsty”. The journey is beautiful and it is my hope and prayer that all of you cherish every single second of it!!  
<em>“.. I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.” – Philippians 3:13-14</em>
