The Develop With Passion - Software Craftmanship Bootcamp is Once again making its way back to the UK. The course is scheduled for the week of the 22nd of August (next month), and will once again be run in London.

If you are not familiar with the course, here are the things you can expect out of the 5 crazy days!:

- Awesome programming challenges
- Deep dive into core software design principles
- Deep dive into practical application of recurring software patterns
- Practical introductions to functional programming techniques
- Getting back to the "Design" in test driven design
- Great lunch and dinner conversations
- How to gain confidence with the skills you have, and charting a course for growth for the rest of your career
- Engaging conversations with like minded professionals who are interested in growing their skillset
- Learning how to avoid the “Keeping up with Jones” mentality to software development
- Tools and techniques to achieve and maintain focus
- Possibly being reminded of how fun software development can be
- Joining a network of over 1000 developers who are now “Developing With Passion”!!

This is just a small list and it does not really cover in depth the technical aspects of the course.
Regardless of your skill level, it is very difficult to come away from this course without feeling challenged in one of the following areas:

- Raw programming prowess
- Time management
- Focus
- Work/Life balance
- Goal Planning

The course was originally scheduled to be held in Manchester, but has since been moved back to London!
